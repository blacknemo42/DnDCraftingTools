Chapter 1 | Crafting

Crafting

Crafting has long been a major focus of the game, and
something countless players have sought to engage with since
the early days; after all, what adventurer wouldn’t want to be
better outfitted, better equipped and more prepared... and
what adventurer wouldn’t want the chance to put their
personal mark on their gear?
The core principle of this crafting system is simplicity and
specificity. Everything works with simple, easy to follow rules,
but has enough depth to lift the burden from a GM having to
fill in every blank by giving specific details for everything.
While a GM is always the arbiter of what exists and if a
crafting recipe works, by and large this system can be run
with as much or as little input as a GM wants to add. It’s a
complete package that provides all the necessarily details for
your players to get started—and plenty of tables and guides for
GMs as well.

Why do you need Crafting?
Some people may wonder: why do you need a crafting system?
Isn’t that what loot is for? The truth is, in some games, that’s
true. Not every adventurer is going to want to pursue crafting.
But with a crafting system, not only can you craft what you
need without finding it in a dragon hoard, what you find in that
dragon hoard can be so much more.
In a game with a robust crafting system, there is no junk,
there are just more opportunities and fresh possibilities. A +1
shortsword that no one can use could be the valuable basis of
a new spear. Gems, gold, relics, and recyclables... all valid
entry points for the crafter’s creativity.
Adventurers are inherently innovative folks on a quest for
creative solutions to difficult problems. Crafting gives them
that toolbox.
So... why do you need crafting? You don’t. But you should
probably want it.

Who can craft?
Anyone! Who can succeed in making something useful?
Perhaps a bit of a different story. Crafting is not inherently tied
to class, though in some cases some classes may give benefits
to it (like Inventor); crafting may come from your background
in the form of a tool proficiency, or it may be something you
learn during your adventures following the old adage of
necessity being the mother of invention.
Crafting is mostly about the time, effort, knowledge and
materials. As such, most of crafting is knowing the recipe and
having the time and materials needed... but a skilled
craftsman works quicker and is more successful, and in this
business practice makes perfect, so there are various
progression modifiers that apply. Your GM can determine if
your background would merit starting your adventure with
any, otherwise guidelines for how to gain them are included.

What can I craft?
Anything! But this guide is made by a mere mortal, and is thus
limited in scope. This guide will provide the principles of
crafting for many fields—from alchemy to engineering to
woodworking.
The basis of how crafting works is similar between each
field, but the recipes, material, and most important results will
be radically different... After all, a healing potion, a catapult,
and a magic sword are all things you can craft, but the process
for each varies quite a bit.
The goal of this document is to teach you how to get started,
and provide the basics that will get you a long way into your
adventure, but not make a complete codex of everything that
could potentially be crafted. When you hit something that

Introduction | Materials | Harvesting | Gathering | Alchemy | Poisoncraft | Blacksmithing | Cooking | Enchanting

Chapter 1 | Crafting
doesn’t appear in this document, just reference the closest
items and make a bit of a leap to what extra steps might be
needed to realize your vision into your game world!

A Player-Driven System
One of the fundamental goals and inspirations of the crafting
system is to make it a player-driven system.
It is a system where the player can say “I would like to
harvest the monster for ingredients” and “I would like to
forage as we go through the forest looking for alchemy
reagents” and ultimately “I would like to make a healing
potion” and all those rules can be exposed to the player
allowing them to directly browse and consider what they want
to make, as well as how to make it.
The GM still adjudicates many instances of them, but the
ideal is to have a system in which the GM does not have to
handcraft every instance of gathering materials and crafting.

Working with your GM

While the system is meant to enable player-driven choice, always
remember to work with your GM. Check in with them when
selecting an item you would like to make and confirm that item
exists in their world, and any assumptions hold true.

Some GMs may rule that some items have higher rarity or are simply
not available at their default assigned rarity. A common example of
this may be something like Winged Boots, which are only rated as
Uncommon, but some GMs may feel they are a better fit for rare and
adjust their difficulty accordingly.

Hooking Your Players In
On the other hand, if the GM wants to get the players into it,
there are some tools they can use. By far the most effective
tool is to give the players reagents as part of loot that don’t
have an obvious place to sell them. If you give players 2
curative reagents, they are going to start looking into how they
can use those, as they’d much rather have a healing potion.
If you want to go one further though, if you give them 5
curative reagents and they realize they will have a remainder
of one... then they start looking into “Well, how do we get a
6th!”

Depth and Complexity
This system has two goals: to be simple and easy to use, and
to be deep and extensible. Naturally these are somewhat at
odds, and accomplished by having a great deal of optional
depth. To produce standard items with standard effects, the
process for finding or buying the materials and using them to
make what you want to make will be straightforward.
How much of the detail you want to engage with as a GM
can be easily adjusted by how you hand out reagents. By
sticking to the standard ingredients and using their generic
names, the materials are no more complicated than handing
out gold or other rewards (and can even be fully converted
easily to a gold-based system if you want the most simplified
version), but if you’d like to have specific ingredient names and
exotic ingredients there is information in the appendix you
can draw from for that.

How to Craft
Crafting under this system is very simple. You collect the
ingredients for a particular thing you want to make, and use
your skills with tools to make it into that item. The crafting
time of this system is very compressed compared to the
systems you might find in the base options because this
system is not intended to use downtime to gate crafting.
Rather, this is built to work with an adventuring lifestyle.
You might need a little time here and there, but it will be
measured in hours rather than days and weeks. Consequently,
the gates to crafted items are instead the materials and skill
required rather than time and gold, though you can certainly
use gold to buy those materials in some cases.
Following there is a quick summary, as well as more indepth
break down of crafting time and checks, materials and where
to find them, and finally the specifics of each branch.

Generic Ingredients

Above and throughout the document, you will see that ingredients
are referred to by generic tags like “common curative reagent”
rather than specific natures. For example, you may harvest magical
herbs, and find Kingsbane in the forest, a poisonous plant. For the
purposes of crafting, this can be recorded simply as a “common
poisonous reagent” and used as such in crafting.
This greatly simplifies the process of crafting and recording what
your supplies are. Narratively speaking, a skilled alchemist can render
down the ingredients they want to use in the form they need.
Each crafting profession will have some profession-wide materials
that are used in their recipes: reagents for alchemy, metals for
blacksmithing, etc.
Some very rare and legendary items will have specific ingredients;
this is for flavor rather than balance, though it is up to your GM.

Quick Summary
Each step will be outlined in more depth, but the following
serves as a summary and reference for the process.
• Select an Item. Find the item you would like to craft on a
crafting table.
• Check with your GM. They will confirm if that item exists
and has the default rarity in their game. This system is a
tool, it does not supersede worldbuilding.
• Gather the materials. Materials can be looted from
humanoids, harvested from more exotic creature types,
purchased at stores, or gathered from the wilderness. The
specifics of any material and where it can be found is
covered in the materials section.
• Begin crafting! You can find the related tool and ability
score on the table below. Use the related tool and skill to
determine your crafting modifier using the following
formula:
Crafting Modifier = your Related Tool proficiency bonus +
your Related Ability Score modifier.
• You can make progress in 2 hour increments. For each 2
hours spent, make a crafting roll using the formula above
and compare the result to the DC listed for the item
• On failure, no progress is made. If you fail three times in a
row, the crafting fails and all materials are lost.
• On success, 2 hours of progress is made, and you can
mark your progress put it aside or continue to craft.

Chapter 1 | Crafting
• Once your completed progress on an item is equal to the
crafting time listed, the item is complete.
• You’re done! Enjoy your shiny new item!

Special Reminders:
• You can “take 10” on a crafting recipe by doubling the
crafting time.

• The final say on any item is up to your GM. If they disagree with the
written recipe, they are correct!
• Don’t be afraid to ask where you can find materials—the GM wants
you to engage with the world and find things!
• A crafting roll is a special kind of check. You can’t apply boosts
other than expertise to your crafting check. In general, the only
way other than expertise to boost a crafting roll is to get help
from another skilled crafted for the entire duration of the craft.
Remember you can use the take 10 option to get slower more
certain success, and if a craft has a higher DC than you can
achieve using that method, it likely should involve some degree of
difficulty and risk.

Reference Prices
The prices of this system reference the default prices
presented for magic items in 5e, as follows. You don’t need to
use these prices if you use an alternate economy, but the
prices presented are default for ease of use and conversion.

Default Pricing

25–50 gp

50–100 gp

2,500–25,000 gp

Legendary

25,000+ gp

101–500 gp

501–5,000 gp

5,001–50,000 gp
50,000+ gp

Converting Prices

There are alternative pricing models presented in the appendix. If
you use a simple conversion, such as 1/10th pricing using some sort
of silver-based pricing, you can simply divide based on that. If you
have a more complicated pricing version, my recommendation is
to pick a few core items and use them as a point of reference for
a conversion formula (I’d recommend healing potions, +1/+2/+3
weapons, and plate armor).

Valuable Gear
In some cases, you may want to make something that is more
valuable. While selling more valuable gear may be quite
difficult, as is often said, magic has expensive tastes. Many
magic items that an Enchanter might want require items of a
certain value.
Here’s some examples of specific modifiers you can add to
increase the value of an item:
Modifier
Bejeweled
Gilded

Material

Difficulty

Value Added

Gemstones

+1 per gem

Value of Gem

10 gold scraps

+2

+20

Additionally, you can generally increase the value of an item
simply by making it more ornate and exercising greater
craftsmanship. You can, when you start crafting an item, raise
the DC and/or crafting time of that item artificially. When you
do so, that items value is recalculated using the Labor Cost
Table in Appendix A.
Here is a list of example break points of more expensive
mundane items using different variations of material cost, DC,
and number of checks. These are all simply the iterations of
the formula presented in Appendix A.

Chapter 1 | Crafting

Example

To walk through these prices:
• A simple item listed here has 1 sp of materials, and takes 1
check with a DC of 8. That is a labor cost of 1 sp, 1 sp of
materials, and consequently, the item has a value of 2 sp.
• A fancy item here has 100 gp of materials, but also takes 8
checks at a DC of 15! That is a labor cost of 144 gp and a
small risk multiplier (the chance you lose your materials)
resulting in a value of 250 gp.
• The presented masterwork item has very little material
cost with only 1 gp, but is extremely hard to make with 5
checks with a DC of 20, resulting in a massive labor cost of
995 gp, and a final value of 1,000 gp.
So, for example, if you needed a longsword that was worth
1,000 gp, you have a few options:
• You can add a gem worth 985 gp to the materials when
crafting it, resulting in 15 gp + 985 gp.
• You could raise the checks to 5 and the DC to 20.
• You could spend 250 gp of materials, raise the DC to 19,
and spend 6 checks making it resulting a sword worth
1,103 gp.
• These cases are largely something you only need to
consider when making items for enchanting, and it’s all
quite a bit simpler than it might seem, as it’s just
expressions of the formula presented in Appendix A.

Making Your Own Items
This system is designed to be extensible. While it contains
many things, it does not (and cannot!) contain all the things.
You can find the rules for building new items in Appendix A:
Creating New Items.

Item Key
At some points on the tables that follow you will see some
notification such as K. This represents an item that is not core
to 5e and has been added by the creator of this Compendium
(standing for Kibbles). Some other keys:
• GS = Griffon’s Saddlebag. Content used with permission
from Griffon’s Saddlebag
• DS = Dungeon Strugglers. Content licensed or
commissioned from Dungeon Strugglers.
• TAG = TheArenaGuy. Content provided by TheArenaGuy
of Spectre Creations.
Use of these items is optional, they exist to flesh out the
lists, show how to extend the system, and, in the case of the
contributed items, because they are cool items!

Crafting Time
All items have a crafting time measured in hours. Crafting is
completed in 2 hour chunks. Some branches of crafting must
make all their checks consecutively (like Alchemy) while some
do not (like Blacksmithing or Enchanting). A crafting roll is
made every 2 hours of work on an item.
On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the
completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is
complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress
has been made during the 2 hours.
If you fail three times in a row, the crafting is a failure and
all materials are lost.

Crafting During a Rest
During a long rest, you can make up to 2 hours of progress
during a crafting project if you do nothing else during the long
rest besides craft and sleep. During this time, you have
disadvantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks and a −5 to
all Passive Perception checks as you are focused on your
craft.
You can make 2 hours of progress on any crafting project by
taking this camp action. For most projects, this progress can
be banked completing the project 2 hours at a time. For some
types of crafting, like alchemy, you can’t make incremental
progress, but you can continue for 2 additional hours of
crafting before or after a long rest in which you took the camp
action “craft” to get 4 hours (for example).

Camp Actions

A recommended system is the Kibbles Camp Actions which can be
found here and provide more formalized rules for how to make use
of your time during a long rest.

Crafting Rolls
Each profession lists the related ability modifier and tool used
to calculate your crafting roll modifier. In many cases,
attempting to craft without the applicable tool is impossible.
Your GM may allow improvised tools, and in that case the
check is made with disadvantage.
Beyond the tool, most branches of crafting require a heat
source, and some require more infastructure. These are
generally approached logically and are at the discretion of the
GM. For an adventurer looking for more portable workshop
tools, investigate the Crafting Magic Spells and Crafting Utility
Magic Items sections; these offer additional avenues for
increased portability.
Here is a list of some of the additional requirements by
branch:
• Blacksmithing can perform minor crafts with a simple heat
source, but requires a forge and anvil to make new items.
• Alchemy and Cooking almost always requires a heat
source.
• Tinkering, Jewelcrafting, and Poisoncraft sometimes
require a heat source.
• Enchanting, Scroll Scribing, Woodworking, Wand
Whittling, Poisoncraft, Leatherworking, Engineering,
Runecarving rarely require anything besides the tools of
the profession.

Chapter 1 | Crafting

Expertise

Features that grant tool expertise (the ability to add twice your
proficiency bonus to ability checks made with a tool) are
calculated into your crafting roll modifier, but do not add to an
the calculated DC the effects of that item have.

Bonuses

A crafting roll is a special type of ability check and you can’t
add temporary bonuses to your roll (such as Bardic
Inspiration or the spell guidance) as the crafting roll
represents the entire time you spend working the item.
In general, the intention is that no external bonuses apply,
unless they specifically state they do. This would include feats
(such as ones that allow you to reroll certain rolls), class
features (such as ones that allows you to add dice to certain
rolls), etc. A GM can apply these bonuses, but they are not
intended to work, and can result in checks becoming too easy.
You can gain can advantage if another player with
proficiency in the related tool helps for the whole crafting
time.

Taking 10

When you craft something, double the crafting period (from 2
hours to 4 hours per check) to “take a 10” on the crafting roll,
meaning that your crafting checks are 10 + your related ability
score + your related tool proficiency bonus. This provides a
floor level that you can always succeed on if you choose to
take your time.
If someone with proficiency is aiding you for the entire
duration of the crafting, the crafting check doesn’t gain any
bonus, but can be completed in the standard 2 hours.

NPC Crafting

It should always be assumed that when NPCs are crafting, they take
this option, and thus craft more slowly but reliably. The slap-dash
speed crafting is largely the domain of the players, though at the
GM’s discretion the players may convince a NPC to craft faster
assuming the risk of their materials.

Workdays

When a character is spending all day working, they make 8
hours of progress, and cannot exceed 8 hours working on a
crafting project during a day. Players will occasionally want to
work longer than 8 hours, but this fails to account for the
limitations of mortals: player characters still need to eat,
sleep, and will eventually lose their focus and ability to work.
This is primarily implemented for balance reasons, but also
helps model how much productive time a character can
spend; they are not just working 8 hours straight and idling for
8 hours, but rather a model of the natural flow of a day, taking
breaks, etc.
A GM can choose to overrule this and allow extreme
crafting days in special circumstances, but in almost all cases
working over 8 hours on a crafting project would leave a
character with one or more levels of Exhaustion.

Materials
Without materials, there is nothing to craft from. Crafting
does not make things from thin air, it makes more useful
things from less useful things. Gathering the materials will be
the essential first step in any job. Materials are generally
found in three ways.

Loot & Salvaging
Nothing is useless when you have a party of crafters. One of
the main sources of materials will be the things you find.
Nothing is useless when you have an expert craftsman in the
party.

Gathering & Harvesting
How something is gathered varies on the profession; in many
cases, it can only be gathered when the opportunity arises.
Dragon scales, for example, are a lot easier to gather when
there is a dead dragon nearby. Be it harvesting rare herbs,
monster parts, or minerals, gathering is an opportunity you
won’t want to pass up.

Purchasing
Rarely will everything you need to craft what you want fall into
you hands without the assistance of the oldest and most
powerful tool of any craftsman: money. When you don’t have
what you need, frequently you can buy it. For some
professions, there will be a lot more materials that can be
purchased, while others will rely more on the other routes.

Selling and Buying Materials

In general, the buying price of a material is its listed value, and its
selling price is usually half of that to an interested property.

Between negotiation, market fluctuation, and GM moods, you
may get better or worse prices. Note that many materials are simply
junk to a party that does not have a use for them, and will only sell to
interested parties that can use or resell them.
Threatening to burn down a merchant’s shop because they will
not offer you the listed price may result in an Intimidation check,
but does not change market realities and is typically not beneficial to
your reputation; most merchants that have the gold to buy and sell
expensive materials have dealt with adventurers before and are not
easily intimidated.

The sources of materials are tied to the pillars of the game.
Looting and Harvesting are tied into the combat pillar,
Salvaging and Gathering are tied into the exploration pillar,
and purchasing and rewards are tied into the social pillar. This
provides a lot of routes to add these materials to your game
based on what works best for your group.

Types of Materials
Reagents
Reagents are a huge range of things; most often they are
plants that contain some magical essence, but almost as
frequently they are harvested from various magically inclined
monsters. The exact source of a reagent usually does not
matter beyond defining its type, as the part of the reagent used
is the fragment of magic contained within that is distilled out.
There are many different ways to make a potion.
Consequently, the materials are sorted into categories. These
categories include curative, reactive, and poisonous. These
each come in the standard material rarities: common,
uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary.
Reagents can’t be salvaged once they have been combined
into another form (such as potions, essences, or ink).
Reagants can be assumed to weigh 0.2 pounds each.

Interchangeable Reagents

All curative, reactive, and poisonous ingredients are
interchangeable. This is intentional to drastically simplify the
crafting process and tracking thereof. Individual names are included
only to deepen the immersion of the finding and buying ingredients,
and can be treated as interchangeable by their label if preferred.

Essences
While reagents are substances that contain a glimmer of
magical power that can be harnessed through refinement,
Essences are more purified forms of magical power.
These come in three types: Arcane, Divine and Primal as well
as in the five normal rarities (common, uncommon, rare, very
rare, and legendary). These essences are the pure stuff of
magic that makes things work.
You can get these by rendering down magical reagents,
salvaging magic items, harvesting them from magical
monsters, or through the hard work of spell casters. Or you
can find them as loot from people that have already done one
of those harder steps. The rules for rendering them down
from materials are contained within each branch of crafting,
while the rules for creating them yourself are under
Enchanting, as it is their domain and skill set needed to do so.
While all branches occasionally use essences when extra
magical power is needed, they are the primary material of
Enchanters, and their pricing can be found in that section.
Essences can be found as loot during the courses of your
adventures, but can also be harvested (from monsters),
salvaged (from magical equipment), synthesized (from
reagents), or created from the raw power of a spell caster,
though the method is long and arduous.
Essences are flexible in their exact nature. There are many
paths to each desired outcome, and this flexibility is
represented in Essences. While the traditional way to make a
belt of hill giant strength may call for a hill giant heart as its
essence, an enchanter may substitute a dragon heart as their
primal essences to make a belt of dragon strength that just
has the same statistical effect.
Essences can be assumed to weigh 1 pound each.

Salvaging Essences

Magical Ink
While ink has many uses, crafting is mostly concerned with
magical ink which has the power to hold the arcane words of
scrolls. This is synthesized by alchemists from the magical
properties of reagents, as it is concerned with extracting their
magical properties, the exact nature of the reagents used do
not effect the final ink beyond its potency.
Magical ink is not typically found or harvested on its own,
though it may be found as loot, and in some instances a GM
could rule that some blood collected from a fiend, celestial or
dragon could be counted as such. It is generally created from
reagents or purchased from alchemists that create it from
reagents.
Magical ink can’t be salvaged once they have been combined
into another form (such as potions, essences, or ink).
Magical Ink can be assumed to wight 0.1 pounds each.

You also may be able to salvage magical essence from
unwanted or broken magical items, though such a reclamation
process can be difficult, and rarely results in more than a
fraction of the essence infused into the original item. An item
returns one essence equal to its rarity when harvested. The
process takes 2 hours to complete, and doesn’t work if the
item is currently attuned to any creature. An essence can only
be salvaged from permanent magic items; a permanent magic
item is one that recharges or doesn’t have a limitation on its
charges or uses. A magic item with charges or uses can only
be salvaged while it is at full charges or uses.
The item becomes nonmagical after the essence is salvaged
from it. If it required magic to function or exist, it is destroyed.

Synthesizing Essences

In addition to harvesting essences from magical monsters
fully intact, a more approachable and incremental way is to
combine several reagents to get an essence. You have to
combine three reagents of the same rarity to gain one essence
of that rarity. You can combine reagents in the following ways:
Essence

Component Reagents

Arcane

1 curative, 1 poisonous, 1 reactive

Primal

3 reactive

Divine
2 curative, 1 reactive
This process takes 4 hours, and requires alchemist’s
supplies and a heat source.

Chapter 1 | Crafting

Making Essences

Another potential source of an Essence is being created by a
spellcaster. This process is long and arduous, and typically
only suited to downtime. A creature with the spell casting
feature can create 1 essence during 1 workweek (5 days, 8
hours a day); this process can’t be completed faster and for the
duration they are considered to have spent all of their spell
slots.
At 1st level or higher can make a common essence in this
way, a caster 5th level or higher can make an uncommon
essence this way, a caster at 11th level can make a rare
essence in this way, and a caster at 17th level or higher can
make a very rare essence this way. Legendary essences
require special rituals, more casters, and take far longer; they
are exceedingly hard to make.
The type of essence produced depends on the source of the
spell casting levels as per the table below:
Caster

Essence Type

Inventor

Arcane

Cleric

Divine

K

Bard

Ingots
Ingots are chunks of metal that can be used to craft things.
They are assumed to be relatively pure and weigh 2 pounds
each. The default ingot listed in all the crafting tables is an
ingot of Steel. These cost 2 gp per ingot. There are cheaper
metals (such as Iron); pure Iron can’t be used to craft weapons
and armor, but can be used for other items, resulting in a
cheaper item. On the other end of the spectrum, more
advanced metals such as Mithral and Adamantine can be used
conferring special properties, but being far more difficult to
work with and costing more.
Ingots can be assumed to weight 2 pounds each.

Salvaging Ingots

Metal items can be converted back to ingots quite efficiently,
but require a forge to do so. With a forge and 2 hours per item,
a metal item can be rendered down into its component ingots.
Advanced metals may require special tools to smelt.

Special Cases Explained

• Sorcerers produce a type based on their subclass; Dragon
or Wild makes Primal, Divine Soul makes Divine, and Shadow
makes Arcane.
• Warlocks likewise produce a type based on their subclass;
Archfey makes Primal, Celestial makes Divine, and all others
make Arcane.
• Occultist can produce any type, but takes 1.5x as long to
produce an Essence in this manner. A GM can rule based on the
special circumstances of a character their power source may be
different than normal. This can stand in for Shaman, Witch, or
Oracle classes if you use those instead of Occultist.
• Inventor can stand in for any half-arcane caster of a
similar theme.
A half- or third-caster would generate essences at 1/2 or 1/3 their
character level, respectively.

Smelting Ore

Creating ingots from raw ore is largely out of scope for most
adventurers, but you can create ingots from raw ore with a
suitable facility. For more details see the Components and
Materials table under Blacksmithing.

Hides & Leathers
Hides, scales, and carapaces all tend to be harvested from
monsters. Leather is a product of hides that can be processed
from what it is harvested from the monster.
The GM determines if a monster provides hide, scale, or
carapace. Hides do not come in different sizes, rather larger
creatures simply provide more hides, and monsters that are
not large enough to produce one hide provide only hide
scraps.
Scales are likewise abstracted: each increment is simply an
arbitrary unit of scales that the unit of scales covers. Scales
can be much larger or small from different-sized creatures.
The system does not attempt to say how many scales a
creature provides or how many literal actual scales makes up
scalemail, but rather provides a number that is then
consistently used.
Creatures are harvested using a Survival check, with its DC
listed below. If the DC check is failed, the harvest does not fail
entirely, but instead they get 1d4 hide scrapes in place of any
hides, carapaces of one size smaller, and half as many scales.

Chapter 1 | Crafting
Processing Hides

The process of turning hide into leather takes quite awhile (as
per the crafting table), and is often something adventurers can
delegate to NPCs (delivering hides to be processed) or do during
downtime. If you would like a more expedited system, there is
no balance reason for this, and you can short the leather crafting
process to taking 2 hours, it just won’t be exceedingly realistic.

Parts
The term “parts” is used to refer to gears, wires, springs,
windy bits, screws, nails, and doodads. Parts can be either
found or salvaged or forged from metal scraps (or even
straight from ingots by a Blacksmith for those that really want
to be industrial about it). The exact nature of each item
making up this collection is left abstracted.
In addition, metal scraps are collections of salvaged
material that generally fall into the category of things “too
small to track” which can then be used for the creations of
tinkerers. In addition to all of this, occasionally tinkers will use
ingots... particularly ones of tin (which is their namesake, after
all).
Like other crafting branches, there are also named
components for more iconic pieces of gear—the stock of a
crossbow, for example, or other items. The cost for these
items can be found on the common component table, and are
generally minor.
Lastly, Tinkerers use essences when constructing things
that push beyond the mundane principles of plausibility,
crafting magical properties into their inventions.

Salvaging

For the most part, wood can’t be easily salvaged. Wood carving
is not necessarily a reversible process, and wood can’t be
smelted down.
You can render wooden crafted product into wood scraps
equal to 4 x the number of branches used to create it.

Quality Branch

A quality branch refers to one that can be made into more precious
objects, particularly bows. It is nonmagical in nature, but typically
yew when dealing with bows, though ash, mulberry, elm, oak,
hickory, hazel, and maple can be used under broader definitions.

Named Components

In almost all cases, named components (such as a “wooden stock”
for a crossbow) can be simply abstracted out as a minor cost, but,
as always, the level of abstraction is up to the GM.

Salvaging parts

The other main way to acquire parts is to salvage them. What
can be salvaged is determined by the GM, but in general
common items provide parts, uncommon or expensive items
may provide fancy parts, and esoteric parts are found only
from esoteric sources at your GM’s discretion. Tools, vehicles,
and complex items generally return 1d4 metal scraps and 1d4
parts for a Small or smaller item, 2d6 metal scraps for a
Medium-sized item, 3d8 metal scraps for a Large-sized item,
and more for larger items, though they may return less of rare
types of parts.

Wood
Commonly available in its lowest quality (firewood), higher
quality woods are often found in rather exotic locations.
Wooden branches (including wood scraps) are assumed to be
of a useful wood that can be worked, while firewood covers
everything else, with more useful woods falling into categories
such as “quality branches” or rarer options. Wood scraps are
assumed to be scraps of common branch quality wood, and
consequently can’t be salvaged from firewood.
Wooden branches can be assumed to weigh 2 pounds each.

Chapter 1 | Crafting

Harvesting & Looting
Harvesting and looting are two paths to the same place, but
generally depend on what kind of foe was vanquished and you
are now collecting the “stuff” of. Typically humanoid creatures
that carry stuff are candidates for the Individual Treasure
tables, while Aberrations, Beasts, Dragons, Monstrosities, and
Plants are harvesting candidates.
If you don’t normally provide loot equivalent to default
treasure tables, you don’t need to start providing loot
equivalient to them using these new tables, simple apply these
tables as frequently as it makes sense for your game.
Remember that you can fully mix and match as it makes
sense. You can replace coinage with gems or art pieces, you
can replace crafting items that wouldn’t make sense with
coinage, gems, or art pieces, etc. The tables are merely a
guide and convenience for what sort of range of materials
should come from what sort of creature.

Harvesting

The Harvesting tables replace the Individual Treasure for
Aberration, Beast, Dragon, Monstrosity, and Plant type
creatures.

Remnants

Remnants optionally replace the Individual Treasure table for
creatures that leave behind no body on death, like Elementals,
Celestials, or Fiends (ones that leave behind a body can use
the Harvesting table).

Loot

The Loot tables optionally replace the Individual Treasure for
humanoid type creatures. You can use this table in all cases or
in some cases.

Recommendation

I would recommend using the table for all humanoid enemies, but
using the Equivalent Gold Value for roughly half of enemies to keep
gold flowing into the PCs pockets while also providing abundant
crafting supplies.

Hoards

Rather than replacing the hoard tables, simply use the default
hoard table and replace an amount of coins, gems, and art
pieces with crafting materials. This ensures that players are
still getting the sort of loot they expect, but also fills in new
materials into things that would often fill little role beside
being converted to coinage at a later date.

Exotic Creature Harvesting
Applicable Targets: Aberration, Constructs, Dragons,
Monstrosities, Plants, Some Undead
A random roll is performed to judge what can be harvested
from the monster. For Dragons and Monstrosities, a Wisdom
(Medicine) check is required to harvest the material without
destroying it, for Constructs, an Intelligence (Arcana) check is
required, and for Plants an Intelligence (Nature) check is
required. Exotic Harvesting takes 10 minutes. At your GM’s
discretion, it may take longer for larger creatures.
If a beast is sufficiently magical, poisonous, or venomous, a
GM can opt to use the Dragon & Monstrosity table for exotic
harvesting, but this should be rare; even a poisonous beast is
usually too mundane for the magical properties of harvested
materials, and a beast should always be rolled on the 0–4 CR
table regardess of its CR.
At a GM’s discretion, some Undead may be harvested as
well if there is something that would make sense for them to
provide in this manner, in which case they would use an
Intelligence (Arcana) check. Undead are less likely to provide
anything of use, simply having a rare chance of providing
arcane essences, though some would consider the use of
these essences evil.

Double Harvesting

If a monster is applicable for both Basic Harvesting and Exotic
Harvesting, you can perform both, but the second check has
disadvantage on the roll to successfully gather the materials.

Exotic Remnants
Applicable Targets: Celestials, Elementals, Fiends, Some
Undead
Some creatures typically do not leave behind corpses. While
these most often disappear without a trace, sometimes they
will leave behind a fragment of the magical forces that
powered them as a remnant, in the form of a reagent or
essence. These are less likely to result in a crafting item, but
don’t require any check to gather it successfully. Gathering
remnants is simple to do, and requires only 1 minute.

Applying Material Tables

As a GM, never feel compelled to roll on a table if you feel it makes
sense to do something else. The tables provide a baseline, but if
you feel that it makes sense of a given monster to leave behind a
given material, simply do so, requiring the check that seems most
appropriate (using the tables as a guide if you wish).

Basic Harvesting
Beasts, Dragons, and Monstrosities can be harvested using
Wisdom (Survival) for meat and hides. At a GM’s discretion, a
Plant type creature can be harvested for food using the same
DC and amount, but providing common fresh ingredients
instead of meat. Basic Harvesting takes 10 minutes. At your
GM’s discretion, it may take longer for larger creatures.

Chapter 1 | Crafting
Gather Reagents

Gathering Tables
Many of the materials can simply be found growing in the
wild, and can be gathered by someone that knows what to
look for and spends the time doing just that. When traveling at
a slow pace through wilderness for 8 hours or more (i.e. not
urban land or farmland), you can make a gathering check, but
have disadvantage on the check to harvest anything found.
If you dedicate 8 hours to gathering without traveling, you
can make two checks (without disadvantage) or find one item
other than an essence of your choice that is available within
that biome’s table (making the ability check from the
corresponding line of the table to harvest it) or 1d12 of any
trivial item (making a DC 8 ability check to harvest it)
The found items then have to be gathered. You can choose
to gather reagents, search for materials, or hunt wild game.
Roll a d100 and consult the corresponding table below for the
relevant biome to determine what is found.

Reagents are harvested by making a Wisdom check. If you
have an Herbalism kit and are proficient with it, you can add
your proficiency bonus to the roll.

Search for Materials

Materials can be harvested with your choice of a Strength,
Dexterity, or Wisdom check. If you have proficiency with the
Survival skill, you can add your proficiency bonus to the roll.

Hunt Game

Food can be gathered with your choice of a Dexterity or
Wisdom check. If you have proficiency with the Survival akill,
you can add your survival modifier to the roll.

Intentionally Slow

Gathering is a time gated system. It is not intended to be the
primary source of materials. Rather than being balanced against
the loot tables, it’s balanced against the down time activities (and
consequently not particularly efficient).

Chapter 1 | Crafting

Alchemy

Alchemy is a crafting art that almost all adventures have some
degree of interest in the results of. The source of the ever in
demand Potion of Healings, it is a versatile trade that fuels
(sometimes quite literally) the adventuring life.
It doesn’t take many experiences with the powers of potions
for an adventurer to consider if they can get away with
simmering a Potion of Healing next to the stew over that
night’s cooking fire... of course it’s easier said than done for
the result of such things to come away not poisonous.
Alchemy tends to be a very quick form of crafting, but with
this comes additional risks with most crafts resting on a single
roll, and failure resulting in the loss of all materials. Although
taking that chance is frequently worth it during a busy
adventuring season, consider the “Taking 10” option outlined
in the craft introduction when speed is not of the essence.

Related Tool & Ability Score
Alchemy works using alchemist’s supplies. Attempting to craft
a potion without these will almost always be made with
disadvantage, and proficiency with these allows you to add
your proficiency to any alchemy crafting roll.
Alchemy uses your choice of your Intelligence or Wisdom
modifier.

Quick Reference
While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference
allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a potion in
its most basic form:
• Select a potion that you would like to craft from the
“Potions Crafting Table”.
• Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that
potion.
• Use your alchemist’s supplies tool to craft the potion using
the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or
during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the
crafting time is 2 hours or less. Alchemy items must be
crafted in a single session.
• For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your
Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice) + your
proficiency bonus with alchemist’s supplies. You can abort
the craft after a bad crafting roll if you wish, this counts as
a failure.
• On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the
completed time is equal to the crafting time, the magic
item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no
progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3
times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all materials are
lost.

Chapter 1 | Crafting

Shelf Life & Expired Potions
A unique attribute to alchemy, potions once crafted have a
shelf life of 1 year before coming expired. This shelf life is
shortened to 1 month if the potion contains any reactive
ingredient.
If an expired potion is used or consumed within double its
shelf life, roll a d4. On a 1, you become poisoned for 1 minute.
On a 2 or 3, the potion will work with reduced effect; its
duration will be halved if it had a duration, and damage or
healing it dealt will be halved. On a 4, it works as expected.
Any potion that is older than twice its shelf life has no effect
besides causing the imbiber to become poisoned for 1 minute.

Crafting Roll
Putting that together means that when you want to work on
Alchemy, your crafting roll is as follows:
Alchemy Modifier = your Alchemist’s Supplies proficiency
bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice)

Success and Failure

For Alchemy, after you make the crafting roll and succeed
mark your progress on a crafting project. If you succeed, you
make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and
have completed one of the required checks for making an
item). Checks for Alchemy must be consecutive, meaning that
if you wish to continue after a failed craft, you need to extend
your crafting time.
Failure means that no progress is made during that time.
Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the
components reserved for that item can only be recovered via
salvage. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and
materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged.

Alchemy Saving Throw

Crafting Walk Through: Alchemy

Here’s a quick example of how alchemy will often play
out in a game.

Caius the Wizard is saved from being eaten by a giant plant monster.
He wants to know if his suffering was worth anything, so he asks the
GM if there was any loot. There wasn’t. Was there anything to harvest
from the monster? Well, that’s always possible. The GM asks for a d100.
Caius rolls a 54.
It was just a CR 4 monster, so the GM consults the table and asks
for a DC 8 Nature Check. Fortunately Caius the Wizard has a +3, so
only needs a 5, and rolls an 8. Harvesting successful and now he has 1
common curative reagent.
Knowing that he’s going to need some healing potions to survive the
next plant monster, he consults the table and realizes that with just 2
more curative reagents and a glass vial he’d have enough materials.
Next time they walk through a forest, Caius the Wizard asks the GM
if there are any reagents about. Slowing down to a slow pass, he can
make a gathering check with disadvantage, and attempts to gather
reagents. Rolls the d100, and comes up with a 73. The GM asks for a DC
10 gathering check using herbalism kit, with disadvantage as they were
travelling. Caius doesn’t have proficiency, but has +1 wisdom, so needs
a 9 or higher. He rolls a 14!
The results in 1d4 common curative reagents. He rolls a 2. That’s all
the curative reagents he needed! He cleans out the remains of an old
healing potion to get a glass vial, and next time they camp, he spends
his camp action (2 hours) trying to make a healing potion.
He needs to succeed only once, DC 13. Fortunately he has
proficiency in alchemist’s supplies, and a +3 Intelligence, meaning his
check is at +5. He needs an 8 or higher.
...He rolls a 3. This a failure! But all is not lost, he can keep trying
until he fails 3 times in a row... but he’s already spent his 2 hours, and
alchemy checks must be made consequetively.
Not wanting to lose his precious hard won reagents, he stays up
late making another check. He rolls a 10! This results in a 15! He’s
successfully made a Healing Potion!
Unfortunately he’s stayed up too late, but the next morning the party
lets him sleep in to avoid the level of exhaustion.
Two days later, Vandrin the Cleric, the groups only healer, is on
death’s door! A quick swig of the healing potion gets him back on
his feet, and the day is won thanks to the hard work of making a
potion, and adventurers keep a keen eye out for more of those
curative reagents!

Some alchemical creations trigger a saving throw. In
instances that they do, the following is the formula for
calculating the saving throw. The saving throw is calculated at
the time of creation based on the creators attributes and
proficiency, and doesn’t change once it is created.
Alchemy DC = 8 + your Alchemist’s Supplies proficiency
bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom Modifier (your choice)

Herbalist’s Limited Alchemy

While herbalism is primarily used for gathering herbs, a creature
with proficiency with herbalism kits has a limited proficiency
in creating potions in addition to gathering herbs. You can use
proficiency with an herbalism kit in place of alchemist’s supplies
when creating potions of healing, antidotes, antitoxins, and
vials of poison.
When crafting in this way, you use an herbalism kit and
proficiency with it in place of alchemist’s supplies. This crafting
otherwise works the same as using alchemist’s supplies.
You can add additional reagent modifiers when crafting
in this way.

Potions
Draught of DamnationK
Potion, rare

This sticky red liquid has a living viscosity to it, churning
slowly within the flask. When you drink this potion, you
become a fiend (as if by the spell shapechange for 1 hour). The
type of fiend you become is determined by your level. The new
form is a random fiend with a Challenge Rating equal to your
level, up to a maximum of 10. If there are multiple options at
that Challenge Rating, roll to determine which option is
selected.
When the effect ends and you revert to your normal form,
you take 1d6 necrotic damage equal to the CR of the fiend
who’s form you assumed as the toxins of pure evil attempt to
destroy your body before relinquishing control of it. If this
damage kills you, your soul is dragged to the realm of the
fiends by the malignant will of the fiend.

cured, all curses are removed, and all levels of exhaustions are
removed, and you cease to age for 1 year. This potion can

If you ever drink a second panacea potion, make a DC 30
Constitution saving throw. On failure, you gain no benefits
from it and die.

Potion of Animal Friendship
Potion, uncommon

Potion of Climbing
Potion, uncommon

When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal
to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have
advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb.
The potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers
resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the
colors.

Potion of Diminution
Potion, rare

When you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce” effect of the
enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration
required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously contracts
to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid
around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.

Potion of Flying
Potion, very rare

When you drink this potion, you can cast the animal
friendship spell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will.
A murky, muddy potion, it leaves various animal shapes and
tracks on the side of the container as it swirls.

When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to
your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you’re in the
air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some
other means of staying aloft. This potion’s clear liquid floats at
the top of its container and has cloudy white impurities
drifting in it.

Potion of Clairvoyance

Potion of Fire Breath

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the
clairvoyance spell. An eyeball bobs in this yellowish liquid but
vanishes when the potion is opened.

After drinking this potion, you can use a bonus action to
exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of you. The target must
make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage

The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1
hour has passed. This potion’s orange liquid flickers, and
smoke fills the top of the container and wafts out whenever it
is opened.

Potion of Gaseous Form
Potion, rare

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the gaseous
form spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you
end the effect as a bonus action. This potion’s container seems
to hold fog that moves and pours like water.

Potion of Growth
Potion, rare

When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge” effect of the
enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration
required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands
from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then
contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.

effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.

Potion of Resistance
Potion, uncommon

When you make this potion, you can make it resist one
particular damage type. For necrotic or radiant resistance,
substitute an uncommon divine essence for the primal
essence. For force resistance, substitute an uncommon arcane
essence. For psychic, substitute an uncommon psionic
essence.
The color of the potion depends on what kind of resistance
it is, often having that element swirling within it.
When you drink this potion, you gain resistance to the
selected damage type of the potion for 1 hour.

Potion of Speed
Potion, very rare

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the haste
spell for 1 minute (no concentration required). The potion’s
yellow fluid is streaked with black and swirls on its own.

Potion of Heroism

Potion of Water Breathing

For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points
that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the
effect of the bless spell (no concentration required). This blue
potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.

You can breathe underwater for 1 hour after drinking this
potion. Its cloudy green fluid smells of the sea and has a
jellyfish-like bubble floating in it.

Potion of Mind Reading
When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the detect

Potion of Poison
Potion, uncommon

This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a potion of
healing or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually
poison masked by illusion magic. An identify spell reveals its
true nature.
If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned.
At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in
this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of
your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful
save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns
decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage
decreases to 0.

the effect ends, you can transform into a bolt of lightning and
instantly travel in a straight line to an unoccupied space you
can see within 30 feet. This movement doesn’t provoke
opportunity attacks and you are immune to lightning damage
while in this form.
You can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and
even mere cracks, as well as through conductive materials
such as metal. Each creature in your travel path must succeed
on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or take 3d6 lightning
damage. You immediately revert to your normal form upon
reaching the destination. This potion’s stormy liquid arcs with
tiny bolts of lightning and it numbs the tongue when sipped.

Sticky GooK

Concoction, common
When broken and exposed to air, it creates a very sticky
rapidly expanding web like foam, with the effect of the spell
web centered on where the flask breaks. You can reliably
throw the flask to a target point within 30 feet, shattering it on
impact.

As an action, you can open this casting gust without verbal or
somatic components. Alternatively, you can breath from it,
letting out only a little bit at a time, breathing directly from the
bottle, but each time you must make a DC 5 athletics checks.
On failure, you cast gust as above and all the air is lost. You
can get 10 minutes of breathable air from one bottle.

Oils
Burning OilK
Oil, common

As an action, you can coat a weapon in this oil and ignite it.
For 1 minute, the ignited weapon burns, dealing an extra 1d4
fire to attacks made with it, and providing bright light in a
20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

Frost OilK
Oil, common

As an action, you can coat a weapon in this oil, causing it
freeze over, covered in icy crystals. For 1 minute, the weapon
deals an extra 1d6 cold damage on hit.

Flametongue OilK
Oil, uncommon

As an action, you can coat a weapon in this oil and ignite it.
For 1 minute, the ignited weapon burns, dealing an extra 2d6
fire to attacks made with it, and providing bright light in a
20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

Oil of Sharpness
Oil, very rare

This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultrathin silver
shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or
up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying
the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is magical
and has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

Silver OilK
Oil, common

A sparkling chromatic oil. The oil can coat one slashing or
piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing
ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the
coated item is considered silvered.

Explosives
Blasting Powder
Explosive, common

A fine grey powder with large grains and the faint smell of
sulfur and charcoal that comes in small packets weighing 1/2
pound.
When ignited by 1 or more fire or lightning damage, it
explodes violently. All creatures within 10 feet of it must make
a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On failure, they take 1d4 fire
+ 1d4 thunder damage, or half as much on a success. The
amount of damage increases by 1d4 (both the fire and
thunder) and the radius increases by 5 feet for each additional
packet of Blasting Powder detonated in the same spot, up to a
maximum of five packets. Deals double damage to buildings
and structures. Creatures in range of more than one stack of
up to 5 explosives at the same time take damage only from the
highest damage effect.
Frequently used for mining and other responsible things...
until adventurers get their hands on it.

Dwarven Alcohol
Explosive, common

Only dwarves really know if the name of this liquid explosive
is a joke or not, but must assume it is an acquired taste. An
explosively flammable liquid that comes in a flask, this flask
can be splashed across a 5 foot square within 5 feet. Once
splashed, it can be ignited by 1 or more fire or lightning
damage. When ignited it explodes in a plume of fire, dealing
2d4 fire damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the container,
or within a square that has been soaked with it.

Grenade Casing
Explosive, uncommon

A simple construction of a two chambered projectile (typically
made of glass). When you add an Alchemist Fire and an
Explosive to its separate compartments, it becomes an
incredibly dangerous device. As an action, a character can
light this bomb and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away.
Creatures within the range of the explosive used must make a
Dexterity saving throw against the DC of the explosive used,
or take damage equal to the explosion + 1d4 piercing damage
+ 1d4 fire damage.

Nail Bomb

Miscellaneous

A brutal instrument, this mixes explosive powder and nails to
create a devastating fragmentation device. An exceedingly
dangerous device. Heavier and more deadly than other
explosives, the primary damage comes from the metal
shrapnel (nails) flung in all directions. It can be detonated by
dealing 1 fire or lightning damage to it. As an action, a packet
of this explosive can be accurately thrown 20 feet, but will not
detonate on impact (usually). When it detonates, all creatures
within 20 feet of the target point must make a Dexterity saving
throw with a DC equal to the crafter’s Alchemy DC. On failure,
they take 8d4 piercing damage, or half as much on a success.
You can fuse your explosives. When fused, intentionally
dealing fire damage to the explosives (or otherwise lighting
the fuse) causes it to detonate on a delay, selected from: short
(the end of your turn), medium (the start of your next turn),
and long (2 rounds, at the start of your turn).

Magical Ink

Explosive, uncommon

Component, common/uncommon/rare/very rare/legendary
Magical ink that is used by Enchanters to create scrolls, made
by rendering down magical alchemical ingredients.

Smoke Powder
Explosive, common

A fine grey powder with large grains and the faint smell of
sulfur and charcoal that comes in small packets weighing 1/2
pound.
When ignited by 1 or more fire or lightning damage, it
releases a blast of thick black smoke that fills a 20-foot radius.
Everything in this smoke is heavily obscured for 2d4 rounds.
At the start of your next turn after the number of rounds
rolled, the smoke begins to fade leaving everything within the
radius lightly obscured, and it clears completely at the start of
your next turn after that.
Additional uses of the smoke powder extend the duration of
heavy obscurement for an extra 1d4 rounds.

Simple/Potent/Powerful Explosive
Explosive, common/uncommon/rare

A bundled explosive alchemical preparation. It can be
detonated by dealing 1 fire or lightning damage to it. As an
action, a packet of this explosive can be accurately thrown 20
feet, but will not detonate on impact (usually). When it
detonates, all creatures within 10 feet (for common) of the
target point must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC
equal to the crafter’s Alchemy DC. On failure, they take 1d8
fire + 1d8 thunder damage, or half as much on a success.
Creatures in range of more than one explosive take damage
only from the highest damage effect.

Chapter 1 | Crafting

Blacksmithing
Blacksmithing is a popular professional interest of two sorts
of adventurers: those that want to hit things with heavy metal
objects, and those that want a heavy metal object between
them and the thing hitting them.
While often relying on the town blacksmith to do their work
for them is a fine option, rolling up your sleeves and doing the
work yourself can allow you to express your creativity... and
may save you a few coins in the process.
Blacksmithing is slow hard work, but has a higher tolerance
for failure than most, and is more dependent on knowing your
material, as the templates you work from tend to be common
across many of them.

Related Tool
Blacksmithing works using blacksmith’s tools. Attempting
to craft an item without blacksmith’s tools will often be
impossible, though a GM may let you use makeshift tools to
make a check with disadvantage. Proficiency in blacksmith’s
tools allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any
blacksmithing check.
While Blacksmiths can benefit from their skills in small
ways such as sharpening their weapons and retrofitting their
gear on the go, many of their crafting options require a fully
equipped Forge; a fully equipped Forge entails forge, anvil,
and blacksmith’s tools.

Quick Reference
While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference
allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a blacksmith
item in its most basic form:

• Select the item that you would like to craft from any of the
Blacksmithing Crafting Tables.
• Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that
item.
• Use your blacksmith’s tools to craft the option using the
number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column.
• For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your
Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus with
blacksmith’s tools.
• On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the
completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is
complete.
• On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has
been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row,
the crafting is a failure and all materials are lost.

Magical Forges

The worlds of the planar multiverse are a fantastical place with
many wonders. Sometimes you may find locations that have been
constructed in such a way as to leverage powerful primal powers in
the forging technique: for example, a forge at the heart of a volcano
or atop an ever-frozen glacier, which might imbue items crafted
there with special properties.

Crafting Roll
Putting that together means that when you would like to smith
an item, your crafting roll is as follows:
Blacksmithing Modifier = your Blacksmith’s Tools
proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier

38

Chapter 1 | Crafting

Success and Failure

After you make a crafting roll, if you succeed, you make 2
hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have
completed one of the required checks for making an item).
Checks for Blacksmithing do not need to be immediately
consecutive. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and
materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged. Failure
means that no progress is made during that time.
Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the
components reserved for that item can only be recovered via
salvage.

Maintain Gear

Materials

Rarity

Price

One of the perks of having a blacksmith in the field is their
ability to keep gear in its best condition, giving you an edge
(sometimes literally) in the quality of your gear and weapons.
Over the course of 2 hours, a Blacksmith can maintain a
number of weapons or sets of armor equal to their proficiency
bonus, granting each weapon or armor maintained a special
d6 Quality Die.
For a weapon, this can be rolled and added to an attack or
damage roll, representing a case where the perfect state of the
gear turned a miss into a hit or dealt a bit of extra damage. For
a set of armor, the die can be rolled when hit by an attack, and
the damage taken from that attack can be reduced by that
amount.
Rolling this die doesn’t require an action, but once rolled it
is spent and can’t be regained until the blacksmith maintains
that armor or weapon again.

While the field crafting of armor is often not possible, you can
make smaller adjustments on the go. Over the course of 2
hours, you can turn a set of plate mail into a half plate or a
breastplate, refit a set of heavy or medium armor to fit another
user that is equal in size or smaller than the original user.

“Ice/Dark/Fire” Steel Ingots

The names for Icesteel, Darksteel, and Firesteel are intentionally
generic to better map to unique metals that might be present in
your setting, and may have other names. Adamatine and Mithril
tend to be widespread (and consequently open source metals), but
other more unique metals may vary based on setting.

Maintenance & Modifications
While the primary purpose of Blacksmithing is to forge armor
and weapons from metal, for an adventurer such events are
important milestones that generally will not occur everyday.
The following are some tasks that require proficiency with
Blacksmith’s Tools that provide a more day-to-day utility to the
proficiency, giving them minor ways to enhance or adapt their
gear.
These are minor crafts can be completed in 2 hours (or as
one camp action when using the Kibbles’ Camp Actions rules)
with the expenditure of 5 gp worth of materials. They can be
done as part of a long rest, but have limitations the normally
crafted items do not (such as a maximum stockpile of minor
crafts).
The following are “minor crafting options” for Blacksmiths:

Every adventure has slightly different preferences in their
gear, and your skills allow you make slight modifications to
nonmagical weapons made of metal. These modifications take
2 hours, require a heat source, and require you to pass a DC
14 blacksmithing tool’s check (on failure, the weapon is
damaged and has a −1 penalty to its attack rolls until fixed).
You can perform one of the following modifications:
• You can weight a weapon, giving it the heavy property. If it
did not already have the two-handed property, it gains the
two-handed property.
• You can remove the heavy property from a weapon,
reducing its damage dice by d2.
• You can add the light property to a weapon without the
heavy property, reducing its damage dice by d2.
• You can silver the weapon (requires 5 silver scraps,
doubled for two handed weapons).

Note: Imperfect Results

Using this method will make some... bad weapons. That is largely
intentional. If you want to make a more functional weapon, you can
make it from scratch using the Weapon Template. This represents
quick hacks to an existing weapon.

Repair Gear

Sometime in the course of adventuring, weapons or armor
will become severely damaged, suffering a penalty to its attack
rolls or AC. Over the course of 2 hours, you can repair this
damage, though at the discretion of the GM you may need
other materials to perform this task if it is heavily damaged.
Weapons that are entirely broken (such as a snapped sword)
are generally beyond simple repair.

Custom Weapon Guide

At first glance, it seems that the weapon selection in 5e is quite limited, but with a little knowledge of the system, you can largely
expose that template that builds those weapons, and from there, well, the opportunities are limitless! When you would like to
craft a template weapon, just follow the steps below:

Weapon Creation Template
To create a weapon go through five steps to determine the final damage and properties of the weapon. Adding a d2 means
increasing the die by one size (e.g. a d6 + d2 = d8) and the converse for subtracting a d2.

Step 4: Set Damage Die/Dice...

You can divide your damage die into smaller dice that equal the same total. For example, a d12 can become 2d6 or be reduced
again to 3d4. Each time you do this, the crafting Base DC increases by +1. You can’t divide dice to be lower than d4.

Step 5: Select Damage Type

Slashing

Deals Slashing Damage

Bludgeoning

Piercing

Bonus Step: Modifiers and Materials

You can additionally add Material Modifiers and Crafting
Modifiers to template weapons. These modifiers may add
additional properties as listed by the modifier, and their
difficult modifier is incorporated into the weapon.

Notes:
• Thrown can be ranged weapons instead of melee weapons.
(Example: Dart)

• The GM can waive the restriction on heavy property requiring

two-handed property but should be aware it opens the door to

Additional Items

Beyond the System

Tower Shield

While blacksmithing allows for a huge amount of custom
creation, there will always be new things beyond the system.

Common
This is a massive unwieldy shield. While carrying it, your
speed is reduced by 10 feet. At the end of each of your turns,
pick a direction . You have half cover from attacks in a cone
that direction. Alternatively, you can pick a single target,
tracking the movement. You have half cover against attacks
from that target (and only that target).

Spiked Shield

Common
Your shield is considered a martial melee weapon, dealing
1d4 damage on hit.

Bracers

Common
While wearing bracers and not using a shield, as a reaction
to being hit by an attack, you can attempt to parry the attack
with your bracer, adding +2 AC bonus against the triggering
attack.

Adamantine Bracers

Uncommon
While wearing bracers and not using a shield, as a reaction
to being hit by an attack, you can attempt to parry the attack
with your bracer, adding +2 AC bonus against the triggering
attack. If this causes your AC to be exactly equal to the attack
roll and the attacking weapon is made of a common metal, the
attacking weapon is destroyed.

The following is some guidelines for how to make something
beyond the system.
• Trivial items should be composed of metal scraps, and
have a DC in the range of 8–12. These represent things
blacksmiths can easily make. Common items should
require ingots, and have a DC of 12–18 depending if they
are simple or exotic. Uncommon and rarer items should
have uncommon and rarer materials matching their rarety.
• Blacksmithing alone can make magical weapons only to
the extent that magical components are used.
• If you would like Blacksmithing alone to make fully
magical swords, you can largely just take the materials
from an equivalent enchanting recipe and add them to
materials of the weapon, and then take the higher of the
difficulty and crafting time of the projects.

Work Together and be Reasonable

The system is, by its nature, extremely extensible. Great pains
have been taken to make things as “balanced” as possible. But this
doesn’t mean the rules transcend common sense. As a player, tell
your GM what you want to make and be open to adjustments to
how it would work. As a GM, tell players how their projects will
work from the start, and be open to the idea they can make cool
things... these crafted items are part of their “loot” and don’t need
to be “power neutral” as long as they aren’t breaking anything.

Thunder Cannon

Requires attunement
The principle weapon of a Thundersmith. Deals 1d12
piercing damage, and has the Ammunition (60/180), TwoHanded, Loud, and Stormcharged properties.
• Stormcharged. When you use an action, bonus action, or
reaction to attack with a Stormcharged Weapon, you can
make only one Attack regardless of the number of attacks
you can normally make. If you could otherwise make
additional attacks with that action, the weapon deals an
extra 3d6 lightning or thunder damage per attack that was
foregone.
• Loud. Your weapon rings with thunder that is audible
within 300 feet of you whenever it makes an attack.

Chapter 1 | Crafting

Enchanting
Enchanting is a hard and expensive profession, but one
eagerly pursued by many all the same. The makers of
miracles, the craftsmen of wonder, no other profession holds
the fascination of adventurers quite like Enchanter, for their
domain encompasses the large majority of magical items.
An item need not pass through an enchanter’s hands to be
magical, indeed many a blacksmith has forged a magical blade
with the right materials, but the true wonder of enchantment
is to turn the mundane magical. An enchanter can turn even
the most base and commonplace item into something
wonderful and powerful, and when given the head start of
working with an already well crafted item can craft things of
legend.
Many enchanters further specialize in subdomains such as
Scroll Scribing or Wand Whittling for more specialized good
that require more specialized tools, with many even pursuing
such things as Jewelry Crafting in order to create the precious
items that most easily enchant, but the general field of
Enchanting still covers a large swath of the wondrous.
Scrolls are heavily featured as a component of nearly all
magical items, forming the basis for the powerful enchantments that imbue them with their magic. These are templates
of a sort, and thus the ability to craft scrolls with Scroll
Scribery is often the most desired of the subdomains for an
Enchanter.

Quick Reference
While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference
allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a magic
item in its most basic form:
• Select the magic item that you would like to craft from any
of the Magic Item Tables.
• Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that
item.
• Use your Arcana skill to infuse the option using the
number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or
during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the
crafting time is 2 hours or less.
• For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your
Intelligence modifier + your Arcana proficiency.
• On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the
completed time is equal to the crafting time, the magic
item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no
progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3
times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all materials are
lost.

Related Skill & Ability Score
Rather than any one tool, Enchanting primarily uses the
Arcana skill. Due to the subdomains of scrolls (Scroll
Scribing) and runes (Runecraft) being part of enchanting,
proficiency in Calligraphy Tools is often useful.

Introduction | Materials | Harvesting | Gathering | Alchemy | Poisoncraft | Blacksmithing | Cooking | Enchanting

Chapter 1 | Crafting
Enchanting uses your Intelligence modifier. While magic
comes in many forms (Arcane, Primal, Divine) and many
casters are able to control it with other aspects of their talent,
the ability to systematically bind it into magic items requires a
deep understanding of its inner workings that can only be
accomplished through meticulous study and knowledge.

Psionic Items

The items listed on the Psionic Items table is the exception to
this rule. These are items infused with psionic power, and instead
use the “Psionics” skill, a skill that any psionic character can be
considered proficient if not using special psionics rules.

These items are something of a subtype of enchanting, and may not
exist in your setting if psionics aren’t included. Consult your GM.

Materials: Essences & Components
The materials of enchanting are Essences and Components.
Essences come in three different types: Arcane, Primal, and
Divine—as well as five rarities: common, uncommon, rare,
very rare, and legendary. What an Essence is can vary greatly,
as they are things of innate magic that is used to power the
Enchanter’s creations.
They could be organs of magical monsters (such as the heart
of a dragon which would be a rare primal essence) or they can
be synthesized from magical reagents into a magical
compound. Components are a broad category of items
ranging from the base item you are enchanting to any
extraneous bits needed to be added. One unique component
that is present in many enchantments is a Spell Scroll of
various types of spells that form the basis of the sort of the
magic the item has.

Replacing Spell Scrolls
A crafter that is capable of casting magic can replace the spell
scroll in an enchantment with the ability to cast that spell, but
when doing so they must cast that spell for each crafting
check they make on that item. This is an exhausting process,
draining their magic far more deeply than normal casting, and
confers a level of exhaustion each time this technique is used
to replace a crafting check. If a magic item requires multiple
scrolls, only one of them can be replaced in this way, though if
an additional spell caster that can cast the necessary spell can
assist you, they can replace a second scroll, though suffering
the same penalty.

Exhausting & Difficult Method

This mechanic is intentionally quite difficult to use—even for
casters that are capable of casting the spell. The typical process
would be to make the scroll first to formalize their thoughts and
process, laying down the patterns and templates for the magic
item. It also removes a very costly gate in the process, so should
not be easily bypassed.

Crafting Roll
Putting that together means that when you would like to
enchant an item, your crafting roll is as follows:
Enchanting Modifier = your Arcana proficiency bonus
+ your Intelligence modifier

Success and Failure

After you make a crafting roll, if you succeed, you make 2
hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have
completed one of the required checks for making an item).
Checks for Enchanting do not need to be immediately
consecutive. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and
materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged. Failure
means that no progress is made during that time.
Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the
components reserved for that item can only be recovered via
salvage.

Enchanting Example and Walkthrough.

Caius the Wizard has a keen interest in magic items. At the start, all
he has is the Arcana skill and big dreams. Let’s walk through how
turn those into a magic item.

Caius the Wizard happens to be a level 4 wizard in this moment
in time. Strangely, he’s the only human in his party, and his lack of
darkvision has been holding them back.
So, Caius decides to embark on making a set of Goggles of Night.
Let’s follow his journey:
First, he'll need to gather that materials. He needs googles, a scroll
of darkvision, a common primal essence, and an uncommon arcane
essence. Goggles are easily acquired from the local merchants for a few
gold pieces, the rest will be a bit trickier.
A common primal essence isn't that hard to come by, and can be
found by harvesting elementals, dragons, giants, or monstrousities,
even at the humble 0-4 CR rating of monsters Caius has been
dealing with.
The uncommon arcane essence will require a hunt. His party takes
on a CR 5 undead, but on their d100, they roll a 64... no luck, all
that was left was some mangled bones and 3 uncommon poisonous
reagents. After a few more tries, it seems luck isn't with them.
Fortunately, Caius has a plan. That uncommon poisonous reagent he
got can be combined with an uncommon curative and uncome reactive
reagent in a simple 4 hour process with Alchemist's supplies and a head
source (page 181).
Boiling them all down, he's left with some magical residue forming an
uncommon arcane essence. Now all he needs is the scroll of darkvision.
Caius really should have this spell long since given his darkvision
shortcomings, but never got around to it. So Caius shells out 90 gp to
buy a scroll of it. Not to learn it though, of course, as soon he'll never
need that spell again!
All the pieces are assembled. As a level 4 Wizard with 16 Intellgience
and proficiency in the Arcana skill, Caius Enchanting Modifier is 2 (his
Arcana proficiency bonus) + 3 (his intelligence modifier), so is 5 total.
During his next long rest, Caius makes his first crafting check, and
rolls a d20! It's a 10. 10 + 5 = 15, so he as a success. He's 1/4th of the
way done, but needs to spend the rest of that long rest sleeping.
The next day he rolls again, 6! That's only 11! One failure. The next
night it's a 15 for a check of 20! That's a second success. Tragedy
almost strikes with the next two checks being a 4 and 2, with results of
9 and 7 respectively, that's two more failures! All of his hard work is on
the edge of being lost.
But Caius asks to take an extra long break at the next town. He uses
the 4 hours to make his next check, taking a 10 on the roll to forestall
disaster. As he wasn't too ambitious and the Goggles of Night are only
DC 13, that means by taking 10, Caius has a minimum check of a 15,
and it's a pass. Feeling better, now that he's no longer one checked
from the whole project failing, he makes his next check on the road,
and gets an 18, for a total of 24. A fourth success, and he can take his
watch that night with darkvision at long last...
...unfortunately he'd been up too late working and fell asleep, so his
party got ambushed anyway, but that's a story for another time!
Caius the Wizard now can see in the dark as well as any pointy eared
elf or long bearded dwarf! It took a bit longer than he'd hoped, but now
Caius has his very first shiny magic item made by his own hands!

Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon
This is a magical piece of ammunition carved with pirate
motifs. This piece of ammunition changes size to fit the size of
the weapon used (becoming large when loaded into a large
weapon). You can use this piece of ammunition to cast
translocating shotK once without expending a spell, targeting
this piece of ammunition. Once used in this way, it can’t be
used again until the next dawn.

Bow of Magic MissilesTAG

Weapon (any bow), very rare (requires attunement by a
creature that is proficient with shortbows or longbows)
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this
magic weapon. In addition, it has 5 charges. While holding it,
you can expend 1 charge as an action and draw the bowstring,
causing two gleaming arrows of magical force to materialize.
You immediately fire each arrow at a creature that you can see
within 600 feet of you. You can direct the arrows at one
creature or multiple, and each arrow automatically hits its
target, striking simultaneously.
You can choose to expend additional charges as part of the
same action to fire one extra arrow per charge expended.
Each arrow deals force damage equal to 1d6 + your
proficiency bonus. The bow regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges
daily at dawn. If you expend the bow’s last charge, roll a d20.
On a 1, the bow retains its +1 bonus to attack and damage
rolls but loses all other properties.
Item by “TAG” (TheArenaGuy) of Spectre Creations

Armor (breastplate), very rare (requires attunement)

You have a +1 bonus to AC and advantage on saving throws to
resist being frightened while wearing this armor.
This armor has 3 charges, which it regains daily at dawn. As
an action, you can expend 1 charge to cast the warding bond
spell or 2 charges to cast the faithful hound spell from the
armor without requiring material components. When warding
bond is cast in this way, a spectral golden retriever appears
next to the creature you are bonded with and follows it
dutifully. The golden retriever is incorporeal and it can shed
bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional
20 feet upon the bonded creature’s request (no action
required).

Captain’s CoatDS

Armor (studded leather), rare (requires attunement)
Functional and fashionable, this long pirate captain’s coat is
reinforced for combat and draws the eyes to its ornate design.
While wearing this coat, you have proficiency in navigator’s
tools, vehicles (water) and you have a swimming speed equal
to your walking speed.
Multiple pockets are hidden on the inside of the coat, able to
conceal small objects. A creature attempting to search your
person must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)
check in order to discover the hidden pockets.
Sailor’s Mouth. Once per short or long rest, you can use a
bonus action to cast the vicious mockery spell (save DC 15)
while wearing the coat. When cast in this way, the target takes
extra psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
Item and art by Dungeon Strugglers

and desk. The atmosphere in the room is comfortable and the
air is breathable.
For each additional 10 cubic feet of space in the object the
door knob is placed in, additional rooms appear, in the
following order:
• A bathroom furnished with wash tub and running water
(the water is potable).
• A comfortable study furnished with a writing table, chair,
bookshelves and fireplace.
• A workshop with basic artisan tools and work benches.
• A kitchen that contains no food, but all basic cooking tools,
and an always hot oven.
• Additional bed rooms, up to four additional rooms.
• Anything created by the extradimensional space can’t leave
the extradimensional space.
These rooms are extradimensional and do not truly exist
within the object, and can’t be accessed by any means other
than through the door (they do not structurally effect the
object, or allow you to access entraces or areas within the
object).

Crystal Ball of ThievingDS

Cascade CatalystK

Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)

Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
This crystal ball is about 6 inches in diameter. While
touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (save DC 17) with it.
You can use an action to cast the mage hand spell while you
are scrying with the crystal ball, the spectral hand appearing
within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. When cast in this way you
can make the spectral hand invisible. When the scrying ends,
so does the spell, and any object held by the spectral hand is
teleported into your open hand or to an unoccupied space at
your feet. Teleporting an object via this method is unreliable
and has a chance to fail. Roll a d20 to determine if you are
successful. If you have had physical contact with the object
before add 5 to your roll. If the object has spent more than 24
hours in your possession, add 10. The DC is 15. On a failure,
the object reappears in the space that it occupied before the
spectral hand interacted with it, or in the nearest unoccupied
space if that space is now occupied. Once used, the thieving
power of the crystal ball can’t be used again until the next
dawn.

While holding this catalyst, you can use it as spell casting
focus for your spells. When you roll damage for a spell, for
each die that rolls its highest value, you can roll one additional
die of the same type and add it to the damage dealt.

Crystal KeyK

Wondrous item, very rare
An intricate crystaline doorknob with intricate carved
patterns. This crystal contains a psionically constructed space
that can be manifested by placing it against any flat vertical
surface large enough for a Medium-sized door to appear on,
and speaking the command word. It creates a door that leads
into this interdimensional space. The size of this space
depends on the size of the object the doorknob is placed
again. If the space is at least 10 feet long by 10 feet wide, it
creates a simply furnished bedroom with a bed, light, chair

Curse. Each time you successfully steal an item using this
crystal ball, the owner of the item immediately sees an image
of your face and hears your name in their mind. They don’t
necessarily know the context, but if your theft arouses
suspicion, it’s a likely deduction that you are related to the
disappearance of their possession.
Item and art by Dungeon Strugglers.

Dagger of the Ogre MageGS

Weapon (shortsword), uncommon (requires attunement)
This blade was once used as a dagger by an ogre, but is
nevertheless large enough to be a shortsword. You gain a +1
bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon.
This blade’s hilt is hollow and can hold up to 3 cantrip spell
scrolls. Cantrip scrolls left within the compartment for 1
minute activate one of the three clear gems adorning its grip.
Once activated, you can cast these cantrips at will using your
spellcasting modifier. If you don’t have a spellcasting modifier,
use your Intelligence modifier instead. You have proficiency
with these cantrips. Cantrips cast from the blade use the
weapon as an arcane focus and allow you to perform any
somatic components with the weapon instead of requiring a
free hand. Scrolls contained within the sword are not
destroyed after using them in this way.
When you cast a cantrip using the sword that deals damage,
the sword’s damage type changes to match the cantrip’s for 1
minute or until you end it early (no action required).
Item and art by Griffon’s Saddlebag

Dark Fathom ArmorGS

Armor (studded leather), very rare (requires attunement)
This dark, sea-soaked suit of armor smells of brine and is
covered in eldritch runes. You have a +1 bonus to AC and can
breathe normally underwater while wearing this armor.
In addition, while wearing this armor, you can use an action
to cast the black tentacles spell (save DC 15) from it. When
cast in this way, the spell targets a 15-foot square centered on
your location that does not follow you when you move. In
addition, you do not need to concentrate on the spell and are
immune to its effects when cast in this way. Once this property
has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dusk.
Item and art by Griffon’s Saddlebag

DecombobulatorK
Wondrous item, rare

This small mysterious device can emit a projected field within
5 feet of it that heats matter until it undergoes a state change,
from a solid to a liquid, or from a liquid to a gas. It has no
effect on gas. The target area is always in the shape of a cube,
and can be as small as a 1 inch cube or as large as a 5 foot
cube. The process takes 1 minute. If a creature ends its turn
in the projected field, it takes 2d6 fire damage. This damage
doubles each consecutive turn it ends in the area. This
damage is also taken by any creature attempting to hold or
touch something in the area of effect. This field may burn
away the effects of some spells that would be subject to its
effects at the discretion of the GM.

Doodle RingGS
Ring, common

This magic wooden ring is always covered in splotches of
charcoal, ink, or paint, regardless of how well or often it’s
cleaned. While wearing the ring on a finger, you can touch that
finger to a solid surface and begin to draw. The drawing uses
your finger to make marks as if it were a piece of charcoal, ink
quill, or paintbrush (your choice). The marks you make can be
in any color. Any drawing made by the ring can be easily
smudged or washed away without leaving any marks behind.
The ring can have up to a total of 5 square feet covered with
drawings in this way at any time. Drawing more than that
begins to erase the previous marks, and any mark left after 24
hours of being made is magically erased.

dawn. When you use the lance to cast this spell, you can
choose to summon a dragon wyrmling instead of a normal
mount by expending a number of charges equal to its
challenge rating (maximum 2). You determine the kind of
dragon summoned, although its alignment towards good or
evil must be the same as your own. If your alignment is
neutral, you can summon a wyrmling of either alignment. The
wyrmling counts as one size larger when used as a mount and
cannot use its breath weapons.
Forceful Impact. If you move at least 20 feet straight
toward a Medium or smaller target and then make a melee
attack with the lance against it while within 5 feet of the
target, you make the attack with advantage instead of
disadvantage. If you hit, you can immediately roll to attack
another target 5 feet directly behind the first, without
advantage, as part of the initial attack.
Item and art by Griffon’s Saddlebag

Dragon Tamer LanceGS

Weapon (lance), legendary (requires attunement)
This slender, iridescent lance is covered in an enchanted
finish that resembles the hardened scales of many dragons.
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this
magic weapon. While attuned to the weapon, you can
understand and speak Draconic.
This lance has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 4 expended
charges each day at dawn. When you hit a target with the
lance, you can expend 1 of its charges to deal an extra 3d6
acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your choice) to
the target. If you expend a charge in this way when you hit a
dragon, it must also succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving
throw or become frightened of you until the beginning of your
next turn. For the purpose of this weapon, “dragon” refers to
any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles
and wyverns.
Whenever you expend a charge in this way to deal extra
damage, you can choose to expend a 2nd charge and deal an
extra 1d6 damage of the same type to the target and prevent it
from using its reaction until the start of its next turn.
Wyrmling Steed. In addition, while holding the lance, you
can use an action to cast the find steed spell from it. Once this
property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next

of lives that are not your own, seeing glimpses of the souls
that contributed their essence to the liquid within the crystal.

Galvanic SpineK

Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunement)
A segmented metallic whip that crackles with lightning. You
have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this
magic whip, and it deals an extra 1d4 lightning damage on hit.
This whip is highly articulated and can move with surgical
precision, allowing it to serve as an extended reach for certain
tasks. As an action, you can attempt to grapple a creature,
entangling with the whip. When you do so, you can make a
Dexterity (Athletics) check to initiate and maintain the grapple
(instead of Strength). A creature that starts its turn while
grappled with this whip takes 1d4 lightning damage.
Additionally, you can pick up objects weighing 10 pounds or
less within 10 feet, pulling them toward you, or interact with
objects within 10 feet. You can use as a set of thieves’ tools +1
when interacting with objects within 10 feet.

Helm of HeroesGS

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
You gain a +1 bonus to AC if you’re wearing no armor while
wearing this helmet. You can still use a shield and gain this
benefit. In addition, while wearing no armor, the helm
becomes suffused with glory and glimmers for 1 minute
whenever you roll a 20 on an attack roll. While the helm is
glimmering in this way, you gain temporary hit points at the
start of each of your turns equal to half your level, and friendly
creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened.

Hero’s SheathK

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a paladin)
An ornate sheath built for a longsword, this sheath infuses a
blade stored within with divine power. When you draw a
weapon stored in this sheath, the first attack you make with it
after drawing it forth has a range of 30/60 (using the weapons
normal attack modifier), and deals radiant damage instead of
slashing damage.
If you expend a spell slot to empower this special attack
using your Divine Smite feature, the blade emits a holy blast
that deals damage equal to the Divine Smite targeting all
creatures within 15 feet. The range of the cone increases by
15 feet for each level of spell slot expended on the Divine
Smite. The target of the attack takes the Divine Smite damage
as normal if the attack hits, while all other creatures in the
area must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 16. On
failure, they take radiant damage equal to the damage dice of
the Divine Smite damage (this is not doubled if the attack is a
critical hit), or half as much damage on a successful saving
throw.
A longsword that is sheathed in this sheath for at least 24
hours is infused with divine power. Its damage die is increased
by one step (from a d8 to a d10, and its versatile damage from
a d10 to a d12) and it counts as magical for the purposes of
overcoming resistance to damage. This bonus lasts until
another weapon is sheathed in this sheathed.

Holy Symbol of the ArcaneK

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric)
This is a special holy symbol often belonging to the order of a
god dedicated to knowledge or magic, imbued with special
power by the god or their agents with the ability to confer
arcane magic to a disciple.
When an attuned user is preparing spells for the day, they
can prepare spells from the wizard spell list in addition to the
cleric spell list, but any spell prepared in this way is prepared
at one level higher than it normally would be. For example, if
they were to use this holy symbol to prepare the fireball spell
from the wizard list, it would be prepared as if were normally
a 4th-level spell (not gaining benefits from being up casted as
a 4th-level spell).
An attuned cleric can have a number of spells prepared this
way equal to their Wisdom modifier.

Hulking BracersK

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While wearing these bracers, as an action you can gain the
Enlarge effect from the enlarge/reduce spell without requiring
a spell slot or concentration. The effect lasts until deactivated
as a bonus action. You can remain enlarged for up to 1 hour
per day, all at once or in several shorter uses. If you run out of
time while enlarged, you shrink to your normal size. The
bracers regain their 1 hour of usage at dawn each day.

Javelin of the Harpy EagleDS

Shawm of SunderingDS

This barbed javelin embeds itself into creatures and hinders
their movement. A creature hit by this javelin has its speed
reduced by 10 feet until the javelin is removed. While you are
within 120 feet of the javelin and you can see it, you can use a
bonus action to speak its command word, causing the javelin
to viciously remove itself from the target and fly back to your
open hand or to an unoccupied space at your feet. You can
choose to remove the javelin as a part of the attack while
wielding it in melee. Alternatively, any creature can remove the
javelin with an action. When the javelin is removed, the barbs
deal an extra 1d6 piercing damage to the creature.
Item and art by Dungeon Strugglers

When a creature adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to
an attack or damage roll, and they hit a target within 60 feet of
you, you can play the shawm as a reaction to deal thunder
damage equal to one roll of your bardic inspiration die to the
target.
Additionally, you can play the shawm as an action to cast
thunderwave, shatter, or lightning bolt, and that spell can’t be
cast from it again until the next dawn.

surface details, such as engraved writing or material
properties, of an object by touching it.
Curse. While attuned to this armor you become obsessively
hygienic. You must spend at least 10 minutes washing your
hands to benefit from a short or long rest and you prefer to
dunk your food into water before eating it.

Squall CollarDS

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
This cold steel choker is forged into the shape of a roiling
storm. It gives you a static shock when touched. It has 3
charges. While wearing the collar, you can use an action and
expend 1 charge to cast sleet storm (save DC 15) from it. The
Squall Collar regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
Amplified. If the Squall Caller is within 60 feet of this
collar, it gains the following properties:
Wearing the collar allows you to see normally through
heavily obscured areas caused by weather or spells such as
sleet storm or fog cloud. The saving throw DC for spells cast
from the collar increases to 16. When you are targeted with an
attack that deals thunder or lightning damage, you can use
your reaction to gain resistance to the triggering damage type
until the start of your next turn. Additionally, the Squall Caller
deals an extra 1d8 of the triggering damage type for 1 minute.
Once the collar is used in this way, the ability cannot be used
again until the next dawn.

Scale Mail of the PangolinDS

Armor (scale mail), rare (requires attunement)

Squall CallerDS

While wearing this armor you gain a burrowing speed of 10
feet. You can use your burrowing speed to move through sand,
loose earth, mud, or ice, not solid rock.
This armor can adjust itself to provide superior protection,
allowing you to curl up into a ball as an action. Until you
emerge (on your turn, no action required), you gain a +5 bonus
to AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution
saving throws. While curled up, you are prone, your speed is 0
and can’t increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving
throws, and you are incapacitated. Attack rolls made against
you do not have advantage normally granted by the prone
condition. Additionally, a creature can roll you along the
ground in front of itself if it succeeds on a DC 10 Strength
check (no action required).
Item and art by Dungeon Strugglers

Weapon (battleaxe), uncommon (requires attunement)
This battleaxe has the thrown property with a normal range
of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. It has 3 charges. While
holding the battleaxe, you can use an action and expend 1
charge to cast gust of wind (save DC 13) from it. The Squall
Caller regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
Amplified. If the Squall Collar is within 60 feet of this
battleaxe, it gains the following properties:
• You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with
this magic weapon.
• Immediately after being thrown, the battleaxe flies back to
your hand.
• The saving throw DC for spells cast from the battleaxe
increases to 15.
• When you cast gust of wind from the battleaxe, the
distance pushed increases by 5 feet and you can choose
any number of creatures within the area of effect to automatically succeed on their saving throw. Additionally, you
can choose to cast gust of wind without requiring concentration, but the spell ends at the start of your next turn.

Savage TalismanK

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While wearing the talisman, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack
rolls and the damage rolls you make with unarmed strikes and
natural weapons. Such attacks are considered to be magical.

Theurge’s LibrumK

Wondrous items, very rare (requires attunement by a wizard)
This hefty ornate spell book remains pristine in all conditions,
its cover depicting detailed sacred inscriptions. After studying
the contents of this book for 8 hours, the user can
comprehend a unifying theory of divine and arcane power,
though such a comprehension mystically fades from the mind
if they ever lose possession or unattune from the librum, until
they are once more in possession and attuned to the librum.
When found, the librum contains the following spells: cure
wounds, bless, lesser restoration, gentle repose, revivify, spirit
guardians, commune, guardian of faith, dawn, and mass cure
wounds. The spells contained within can be prepared as
Wizard spells for the attuned user, but can’t be copied out of
the spell book. Casting these divine spells exerts a special
strain on a wizard, however, and they can only cast a total
number of spell slots of spells that do not appear on the
Wizard list from this book equal to their Wizard level, after
which they must finish a long rest, refreshing the number of
spells they can cast.
In addition, it contains 10 empty pages, each of which can
contain one additional spell from the cleric list. If you come
across a cleric spell in written form (such as a scroll) the spell
can be permenantly copied into the librum, expending one of
the empty pages. The process of copying the spell into your
ritual book takes 2 hours per level of the spell, and costs 50 gp
per level. The cost represents the material components you
expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well
as the fine inks you need to record it.

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
You have a +1 bonus to ability checks using these thieves’

Lost Era EmanatorDS

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
This ancient device is fueled by a mysterious power source. It
hums to life and glows softly when held. The device’s arcane
design is nearly inscrutable and requires careful examination
to decipher its function. In order to attune to the device, you
must first succeed on a DC 16 Arcana check, otherwise the
attunement fails and you can’t attempt it again for 24 hours.
The device has 12 charges. While holding it, you can use the
attack action to emit a ray of concentrated heat from the
device, expending 1 charge for each attack. The device
functions as a ranged weapon with the ammunition and
two-handed properties, a normal range of 60 feet, and a long
range of 240 feet. While you are attuned to it, you can add
your proficiency bonus to attack rolls with the device.
Additionally, when you attack with the device, you can use
your Intelligence modifier, instead of Dexterity, for the attack
rolls. The device deals 3d8 fire damage (this damage doesn’t
benefit from ability score modifiers) to any target it hits.
As an action, you can expend 3 charges to fire a
supercharged ray from the device. The ray is 90 feet long and
6 inches wide. Any creature within this area must make a DC

16 Dexterity saving throw and take 8d8 fire damage on a
failure, or half damage on a success. This ray is able to
penetrate through 1 inch of metal, 6 inches of stone, or 1 foot
of wood, leaving a scorched hole 6 inches in diameter.
The device regains charges by storing arcane energy. Any
creature can cast a spell of 1st through 6th level into the
device by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no
effect, other than to be stored in the device. If the device can’t
hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The device
regains 1 charge for each level of spell slot used.
Orville examined the strange device that he had just
unearthed. It gleamed and glinted in the torchlight, despite its
apparent age, and the craftsmanship was like nothing he had
ever seen. He traced his finger along the intricate grooves and
amber-like appendages, daydreaming about the people who
could have crafted such a curious contraption.

ArcbladeDS

Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement)
This item appears to be a longsword hilt. While grasping the
hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a blade of dark
lightning to spring into existence, or make the blade
disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has
the finesse property. If you are proficient with shortswords or
longswords, you are proficient with the arcblade.
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with
this weapon, which deals lightning damage instead of slashing
damage. When you hit a creature with it, you can cause
lightning to arc from the target to a different creature of your
choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature
takes 1d8 lightning damage.
The arcblade is able to absorb ambient electrical energy to
briefly enter a supercharged state. If you take lightning
damage while this weapon’s blade is active, you can use your
reaction to capture some of that energy and store it for up to 1
minute. The first time you hit with the arcblade before the end
of the duration, the target takes additional lightning damage
equal to half of the damage you took. This property can’t be
used again until the next dusk.

Scrollscribing
Scrollscribing is the process of creating magical scrolls.
Critical both as useful ways to cast spells and as the core of
the magic formula used in enchanting, every adventuring
group’s magic blokes are well served by the ability to make
scrolls.

Quick Reference
While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference
allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a scroll in
its most basic form:
• Select a spell you know that you would like to craft from
spells you are able to cast, or through Alternate Methods
(see “Magic Formula”).
• Acquire the items listed in the materials column for a
scroll of that level and type.
• Use your Calligraphy Tools to write the scroll using the
number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or
during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the
crafting time is 2 hours or less.
• For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your
Intelligence modifier + your proficiency with Calligraphy
Tools (if you have proficiency in the Arcana skill)
• On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the
completed time is equal to the crafting time, the magic
item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no
progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3
times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all materials are
lost.

Related Tool & Ability Score
Scrollscribing works using Calligraphy Tools. Attempting to
craft a scroll without these is impossible.
The related ability score is Intelligence. While spellcasters
of any stripe can make scrolls of the spells they know, the
process is one of systematic application of magical theory to
lay down the spell in a function that can later be used.
Additionally, like its kin Wand Whittling and Enchanting,
proficiency in Arcana is required; without proficiency in
arcana, you can’t add your Tool proficiency to the crafting roll.

Scriptures

A GM can choose to allow a cleric to use Wisdom in place of
Intelligence and require proficiency in Religion instead of Arcana.
Scrolls produced this way are called Scriptures and can only be
used by others of the same faith.

Materials: Ink & Parchment
The materials for Scrollscribing are Ink and Parchment. Ink
and Parchment used in scrolls is typically purchased, and
below are the price tables. Some types of rare parchment may
be processed from rare alchemical ingredients by an
alchemist or from the hides of magical creatures by a
leatherworker. If they are found as part of treasure, they are
calculated as any other precious non-currency treasure would
be calculated.

The ink used to create scrolls must be a special formulation
that allows it to contain the magical essence behind the
glyphs, script, runes, and words that make up a magical scroll.
This ink is created by alchemists, but can be purchased at the
below rates:

Crafting Roll
When you would like to create a scroll, it will depend on your
Intelligence and skill with Calligrapher’s tools:
Scrollcrafting Modifier = your Calligrapher’s Tools
proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

Success and Failure

After making a crafting roll, if you succeed, you make 2 hours
of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed
one of the required checks for making an item).
Checks for Scrollscribing do not need to be immediately
consecutive. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and
materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged. Failure
means that no progress is made during that time.
Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the
components reserved for that item can only be recovered via
salvage.

Crafting Without Essence

A crafter that is capable of casting magic can replace the
essence when crafting a spell scroll with the ability to cast that
spell, but when doing so they must cast that spell for each
crafting check they make on that item. This is an exhausting
process, draining their magic far more deeply than normal
casting, and confers a level of exhaustion for each crafting
check made this way.

A Difficult Process

This is intentionally a difficult process, as stockpiling spell scrolls is
something that should be challenging, otherwise magic can end up
trivializing many encounters, and this method of crafting removes a
large potential cost barrier.

Magical Formula
To craft a spell scroll, you must know the Magic Formula of
the spell you want to make a Spell Scroll of. The easiest way
to do this is to be able to cast the spell. You always know the
Magic Formula of a spell you know how to cast. Otherwise,
you need to have deep knowledge of the spell to be able to

Introduction | Materials | Harvesting | Gathering | Alchemy | Poisoncraft | Blacksmithing | Cooking | Enchanting

Chapter 1 | Crafting
make a scroll of it. The following are some ways you can gain
that knowledge:
• Have it in your spellbook as a Wizard.
• Have it in your spellmanual as an Infusionsmith Inventor.
• Have it in your ritual book as a ritual caster.
• Have a spell scroll of it (DC +2)
• Study its magical formula and record it. To learn a spell in
this way requires proficiency in arcana and 1 day (8 hours
per day) of study per level of the spell, as well as access to a
teacher or book that records the spell. Once learned, you
can record it in a Magical Formula book and can
subsequently make scrolls of it.

Scroll Essence Type

The type of Essence is determined by the spell list the spell
comes from; if it is on multiple spell lists, it is determined by
how you have access to the spell. If you have access to the
spell via multiple lists or the written form of the spell, you can
pick which Essence to use for spells that have multiple
options.

Appendix A: Calculating New Items
The Item

This book is not a book about magic items, and the subject of
how to make an item is beyond the scope of the appendix. This
appendix will help you figure out how to craft an item you’ve
already made. The first thing you need to know is the rarity of
the item and if the item is consumable or not.
Rarity

Difficulty

Commmon

8–12

Time

Estimated Labor

2–8 hours

0.1–16 gp

Legendary

15–18
20–25

24–40 hours

8–144 gp

3,760–3,980 gp

2,388–44,140 gp

Regardless if the item is consumable or not, it should
generally fall into those ranges. Consumable items should fall
to the bottom of the range, while more mechanically powerful
items should fall into the highest reaches. That the labor cost
of an easy to make Legendary Item can be cheaper than Very
Rare items is intentional; the range of item cost and difficulty
is very wide within rarities, even if the final cost of the item
will result in them being ordered by rarity.
The next step is to add appropriate reagents of that the
appropriate crafting branch of the rarity until you reach the
following costs. The easiest way to do this will be to find a
similar item that is already built out, and then replace any item
that doesn’t make sense of your item, or to increase or
decrease the cost of the item as appropriate.

Labor Cost Table
The following is the labor cost table that drives the math of
the system. You do not need actually use this to calculate your
items, a rough estimation will suffice. This is provided for
information purposes only.
• Labor: The cost per check.
• Risk Multiplier: A multiplier applied to the material cost of
the item.
• Skill Level: This means nothing. It is just a narrative key.

Enchanting & Magic Items

5,001–50,000 gp

The most complicated (and most common) use case is
Enchanting. Not only does enchanting use the basic
components of its system, it adds an additional element:
Scrolls. Scrolls serve as the “magic blueprint” to an item, and
replace the rule of recipes or blueprints in the system. If your
magic item cast spells... this step is easy. The item takes the
scrolls of those spells.
If it doesn’t, find appropriate allegories to what the item
does. The obvious example, is a +1 weapon. It doesn’t cast a
spell, but it does have the same effect as a magic weapon spell,
so it can use that scroll. A bag of holding is more complicated,
but you can follow the same logic—the secret chest spell
doesn’t exactly overlap, but it shares some properties... it’s
close enough for these purposes.

Appendix F: Camp Actions
Camp Actions are things you can do during a long rest that
make the most of your time—while adventurers need their
beauty sleep (well, most of them), there’s always a few spare
hours during a Long Rest you can spend in one of the
following ways to better prepare yourself for the harrowing
times to come.
A long rest is 8 hours long, and most adventurers need 6
hours of sleep. This leaves 2 hours of light activity in which to
take a camp action from the following list.

Elves, Constructs, and More

Some 5e races have unique sleep requirements. They consequently
spend less of their time sleeping or sleep in unique ways. They can
take the “Take a Watch” action as many times as they have available
time for after taking care of whatever resting needs they have, but
may take only one other Camp Action while gaining the benefits of
a long rest.

Take a Watch
Adventuring is dangerous, and adventurers often decide to
long rest in strange places—sometimes it’s best to set a watch.

Craft

May require a campfire, and any Wisdom (Perception)
checks during this time are made with disadvantage.

Slumber
Sometimes a hard day of adventuring deserves a little extra
shut eye. Taking this Camp Action is more akin to a camp
inaction, and you get the full recommended 8 hours of sleep.
During this deep slumber, automatically fail Wisdom
(Perception) checks and your passive Perception is 0, however
you reduce any levels of Exhaustion by 2 and awake with 1
inspiration.
Requires a campfire, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks
during this time are made with disadvantage.

Task
Sometimes you will have a task that requires your time, but
doesn’t fit into the above options. For example, copying spells
to your spell book as a wizard. When engaging in such a task,
you can replace your Camp Action with making 2 hours of
progress toward that task.
May require a campfire, and any Wisdom (Perception)
checks during this time are made with disadvantage.

An adventurer that takes this action can make 2 hours of
progress toward Crafting during a long rest. This progress is
made at the end of the long rest. In order to take this action,
the adventurer must have the related crafting tools on hand.
Requires a campfire, and any Wisdom Perception checks
during this time are made with disadvantage.

Cook
A special form of the crafting Camp Action that can be taken
with cook’s utensils. A hearty meal sits better than any trail
rations... even when it is cooked from the simplest of
ingredients. You and all willing creatures (willing to eat your
cooking) regain an additional Hit Die from the long rest when
it is finished.
If you have proficiency with cook’s utensils, creatures regain
additional Hit Dice equal to your proficiency bonus.
Requires a campfire, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks
during this time are made with disadvantage.

Prepare
The life of an adventure has many challenges and it is only
natural a cautious adventurer would want to prepare for them.
Select one ability score to prepare for the upcoming day and
perform 2 hours of an activity that hones it for the challenges
ahead (you could prepare Strength or Dexterity through
stretches or exercises, Intelligence through studying, Wisdom
through meditation, etc).
After you finish the long rest, you gain a Preparation die,
starting at as a d6. Each time you make an ability check
related to your chosen ability score, roll the Preparation die
and add it to the result. The Preparation die decreases by one
step each time it is rolled until depleted (d6, d4, d2, depleted).

Appendix M: Crafting Magic & Items
Crafting Magic Spells
Crafting magic is a unique kind of utilitarian magic. Almost
always ritual based, it is not intended for use in combat, and
comes with some special rules. In most games, crafting magic
spells will not count against spells known, but can only be
learned by being taught or purchased, perhaps known from a

background.
These spells exist for GMs to award to players to make it
easier to use crafting—they are not required, but help
integrate crafting into adventuring, and fulfill a narrative
niche. Though these spells are arcane spells that are primarily
the domain of Wizards and Inventors, a GM can assign them
to any player they would make sense for (for example, perhaps
a Cleric who follows a god of craft, creation, or forging).

Forge Fire

1st-level transmutation (ritual)
Classes: Inventor, Wizard
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 15 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 8 hours
A Medium-sized fire within range, such as a campfire, burns
with unnatural heat within its embers for the duration. It gives
off intense heat, dealing twice as much damage to any
creature that takes damage from it and consumes materials
twice as fast as normal. For the duration, it can serve as a
forge to smelt nonmagical metals, and counts as a forge for
the purposes of blacksmithing.

Process Hide

1st-level transmutation (ritual)
Classes: Inventor, Wizard
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a hide which is consumed by the spell)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You work magic into a hide, turning it into processed leather.
If you concentrate for the duration, you can turn a single hide
into a rawhide leather, boiled leather, or tanned leather.
Alternatively, you can turn hide scraps into leather scraps.

Change Material

2nd-level transmutation (ritual)
Classes: Inventor, Wizard
Casting Time: 2 hours
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a common material used in the casting
the spell, which is consumed by the spell, turning into the new
material)
Duration: Instantaneous

You convert one common material into another material of
equal or lesser mass and value.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 4th- or
5th-level spell slot, you can convert a uncommon material the
same way. When you cast this spell using a 6th- or 7th-level
spell slot, you can convert a rare material the same way. When
you cast this spell using an 8th- or 9th-level spell slot, you can
convert a very rare material the same way.

Conjure Tool

2nd-level conjuration (ritual)
Classes: Inventor, Wizard
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 5 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 4 hours
You conjure an artisan tool of your choice. It is magical in
nature, but serves as a nonmagical version of that artisan tool
for the duration.

Unseen Crafter

5th-level conjuration (ritual)
Classes: Inventor, Wizard
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 60 ft.
Components: V, S, M (a bit of string and of wood)
Duration: 8 hours
This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium
force that performs simple tasks at your command until the
spell ends. The crafter springs into existence in an unoccupied
space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point,
and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit
points, the spell ends.
Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can
mentally command the crafter to move up to 15 feet and
interact with an object. The crafter can perform simple tasks
that a human servant could do, such as fetching things,
cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food,
and pouring wine. Additionally, it can perform skilled crafting
checks. It always uses the taking 10 rule for crafting checks,
completing one check every 4 hours. Its crafting modifier is
+5. When you summon it, you can summon it with one artisan
tool of your choice, which only it can use. It can use any other
artisan tools otherwise available. If you cast this spell again
while the crafter still exists, the previous one vanishes.
Once you give the command, the servant performs the task
to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits
for your next command. If you command the servant to
perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away
from you, the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot
of 6th level or higher, its crafting modifier increases by 1.

Chapter 1 | Crafting

Dimensional Toolbox

Tanning Bag

You conjure an opening to a dimensional toolbox. This is
stocked with every artisan tool and up to 10 gp worth of
common materials. As an action, you can reach in and take
out a tool or material contained within. Any tool or material
that is not used when the spell ends fades away (materials
used in crafting recipes remain).
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot
of 5th level or higher, the toolbox contains +1 tools (tools that
add +1 to the crafting check made). When you cast this spell
using a spell slot of 9th level, the toolbox contains +2 tools
(tools that add +2 to the crafting check made).

Boundless Toolbelt

3rd-level conjuration (ritual)
Classes: Inventor, Wizard
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 5 feet
Components: V, S, M (a key worth 50 gp)
Duration: 4 hours

Dimensional Workshop
6th-level conjuration

Classes: Inventor, Wizard
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 5 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 4 hours
You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts
for the duration. You choose where its one entrance is located.
The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet
tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the
spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the
portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you
are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.
Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous
chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t
exceed 20 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The
place is furnished with every artisan tool and typical crafting
accessory you could need: anvils, furnaces, looms, etc.
Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate
into smoke if removed from the workshop. When the spell
ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are
expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot
of 7th level or higher, the dwelling lasts for 24 hours.

Wondrous item, common
A magical satchel. If you put an unprocessed hide into this
bag, and speak one of three magic words. Depending on the
word, the hide will be processed into rawhide leather, boiled
leather, or tanned leather. This process takes 4 hours, and you
can process one piece of hide at a time.

Wondrous item, uncommon

While wearing this toolbelt, you can cast conjure tool as an
action, drawing forth the tool from your toolbelt.

Potion Fridgebox

Wondrous item, uncommon
This resembles a small wooden box that can fit a container
carrying up to a gallon of liquid in it. You can place unfinished
potions, brews, or similar items in it, pausing the crafting time
on it, allowing you to resume crafting it the item at a later
time.
You can also store perishable liquids in this fridge, and they
will not spoil.

Lucky Material Pouch
Wondrous item, uncommon

A small magical bag that always seems to have the material
you need at the bottom of it. As an action, you can reach out
and draw out any crafting material worth 1 gp or less. After
each time you do so, roll a d4. On a 1, the bag is empty and no
more materials can be retrieved until the next dawn.

Ring of Labor

Wondrous item, very rare
A simple copper band. You can use this ring to cast unseen
crafter. Once used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Workshop Key

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
While attuned to this key, you can can use it to cast
dimensional workshopK without expending a spell slot. Once
you use it, you cannot use it again until dawn the next day.

Crafting Utility Magic Items
Blacksmith’s Bellows
Wonderous item, common

These are a small set of portable bellows. Can be used to cast
forge fireK without expending a spell slot. Once used, it can’t
be used again until the next dawn.
