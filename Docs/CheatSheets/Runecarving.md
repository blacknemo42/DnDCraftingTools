# Runecarving Cheatsheet

## Overview
Runecarving is the art of inscribing magical runes onto objects to imbue them with power. It uses mason's tools or jeweler's tools for crafting and Intelligence for crafting rolls.

## Quick Reference
1. Select a rune from the "Runecarving Crafting Table"
2. Acquire the materials listed for that rune
3. Use mason's tools (for stone/metal) or jeweler's tools (for gems) to carve the rune
4. For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll: 1d20 + INT modifier + proficiency with the appropriate tools
5. On success, mark 2 hours of progress. Once completed time equals crafting time, the rune is complete
6. On failure, no progress is made. Three consecutive failures results in loss of all materials

## Rune Types

- **Armor Runes**: Enhance armor with protection or special abilities
- **Object Runes**: Imbue objects with magical properties

## Tips

- The material the rune is carved into affects its properties

- Some runes require attunement to use
- Runes from different cultures may have different appearances but similar effects
- The size of the rune doesn't affect its power, but detail and precision do
