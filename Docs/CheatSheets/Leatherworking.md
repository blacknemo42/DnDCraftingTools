# Leatherworking Cheatsheet

## Overview
Leatherworking is the art of crafting items from animal hides and skins. It uses leatherworker's tools for crafting and Dexterity or Intelligence (your choice) for crafting rolls.

## Quick Reference
1. Select an item from the "Leatherworking Crafting Table"
2. Acquire the materials listed for that item
3. Use leatherworker's tools to craft the item
4. For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll: 1d20 + DEX/INT modifier + proficiency with leatherworker's tools
5. On success, mark 2 hours of progress. Once completed time equals crafting time, the item is complete
6. On failure, no progress is made. Three consecutive failures results in loss of all materials
