# Alchemy Cheatsheet

## Overview
Alchemy is the art of creating potions, oils, and other consumable magical items using alchemist's supplies. It uses Intelligence or Wisdom (your choice) for crafting rolls.

## Quick Reference
1. Select a potion from the "Potions Crafting Table"
2. Acquire the materials listed for that potion
3. Use alchemist's supplies to craft the potion
4. For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll: 1d20 + INT/WIS modifier + proficiency with alchemist's supplies
5. On success, mark 2 hours of progress. Once completed time equals crafting time, the potion is complete
6. On failure, no progress is made. Three consecutive failures results in loss of all materials

## Shelf Life
- Standard potions: 1 year before expiring
- Potions with reactive ingredients: 1 month before expiring
- Expired potions (within 2x shelf life): Roll d4
  - 1: Poisoned for 1 minute
  - 2-3: Reduced effect (half duration/healing/damage)
  - 4: Works normally
- Potions older than 2x shelf life: No effect except poisoning the user for 1 minute

## Herbalist's Limited Alchemy
- Creatures with proficiency in herbalism kits can create:
  - Potions of healing
  - Antidotes
  - Antitoxins
  - Vials of poison
- Use herbalism kit proficiency in place of alchemist's supplies
- Otherwise follows the same crafting rules as alchemy

## Saving Throws
For alchemical creations that require saving throws:
- DC = 8 + proficiency with alchemist's supplies + INT/WIS modifier (your choice)
- DC is calculated at creation and doesn't change once the item is created

## Tips
- Alchemy items must be crafted in a single session
- You can abort crafting after a bad roll, but it counts as a failure
- Checks for Alchemy must be consecutive
- If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost
