# Poisoncraft Cheatsheet

## Overview
Poisoncraft is a specialized branch of alchemy focused on creating poisons and venoms. It uses poisoner's kit for crafting and Intelligence or Wisdom (your choice) for crafting rolls.

## Quick Reference
1. Select a poison from the "Poisons Crafting Table"
2. Acquire the materials listed for that poison
3. Use poisoner's kit to craft the poison
4. For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll: 1d20 + INT/WIS modifier + proficiency with poisoner's kit
5. On success, mark 2 hours of progress. Once completed time equals crafting time, the poison is complete
6. On failure, no progress is made. Three consecutive failures results in loss of all materials

## Poison Types
- **Contact**: Takes effect when touched
- **Ingested**: Takes effect when consumed
- **Inhaled**: Takes effect when breathed in
- **Injury**: Takes effect when applied to a weapon that deals damage

## Common Poisons
| Poison | Type | Materials | Crafting Time | DC |
|--------|------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Basic Poison | Injury | 1 common poisonous reagent, 1 glass vial | 2 hours | 9 |
| Serpent Venom | Injury | 1 uncommon poisonous reagent, 1 common poisonous reagent, 1 glass vial | 4 hours | 13 |
| Truth Serum | Ingested | 1 uncommon poisonous reagent, 1 common reactive reagent, 1 glass vial | 4 hours | 13 |
| Assassin's Blood | Ingested | 1 uncommon poisonous reagent, 1 common poisonous reagent, 1 glass vial | 4 hours | 13 |
| Pale Tincture | Ingested | 1 rare poisonous reagent, 1 uncommon poisonous reagent, 1 glass vial | 8 hours | 15 |
| Midnight Tears | Ingested | 1 rare poisonous reagent, 1 uncommon poisonous reagent, 1 common reactive reagent, 1 glass vial | 8 hours | 16 |

## Poison Saving Throws
For poisons that require saving throws:
- DC = 8 + proficiency with poisoner's kit + INT/WIS modifier (your choice)
- DC is calculated at creation and doesn't change once the poison is created

## Applying Poisons
- Applying poison to a weapon: 1 action
- A single vial can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 3 pieces of ammunition
- Applied poison remains potent for 1 minute or until it delivers its first successful strike
- Creatures with resistance or immunity to poison damage are unaffected by most poisons

## Tips
- Poisoncraft items must be crafted in a single session
- You can abort crafting after a bad roll, but it counts as a failure
- Checks for Poisoncraft must be consecutive
- If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost
- In many settings, creating or possessing poisons may be illegal
