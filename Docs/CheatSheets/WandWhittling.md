# Wand Whittling Cheatsheet

## Overview
Wand Whittling is the art of creating magical wands and staves that can store and cast spells. It uses woodcarver's tools for crafting and Intelligence or Wisdom (your choice) for crafting rolls.

## Quick Reference
1. Select a wand from the "Wand Crafting Table"
2. Acquire the materials listed for that wand
3. Use woodcarver's tools to craft the wand
4. For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll: 1d20 + INT/WIS modifier + proficiency with woodcarver's tools
5. On success, mark 2 hours of progress. Once completed time equals crafting time, the wand is complete
6. On failure, no progress is made. Three consecutive failures results in loss of all materials

## Requirements
- You must have proficiency with woodcarver's tools
- For wands with spells, you must have access to the spell (either by knowing it or having a scroll)
- Some wands require specific types of wood or branches

## Branch Quality
The quality of the branch used affects the power of the wand:

- **Uncommon Branch**: +1 wands and moderate power items
- **Rare Branch**: +2 wands and powerful items
- **Very Rare Branch**: +3 wands and very powerful items
- **Legendary Branch**: Artifacts and legendary items

## Charging Wands
- Most wands have charges that replenish at dawn
- Some wands risk breaking when the last charge is used
- Wands typically have 7 charges (range: 3-10 depending on power)

## Tips
- Wands are excellent for providing spellcasting ability to non-spellcasters
- Consider the intended user when selecting materials and design
- Wands with multiple spells are more complex but more versatile
- Staves typically require attunement by specific classes
- Decorative elements don't affect function but may increase value
