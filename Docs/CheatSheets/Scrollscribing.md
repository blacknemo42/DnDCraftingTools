# Scrollscribing Cheatsheet

## Overview
Scrollscribing is the art of creating magical scrolls that contain spells. It uses calligrapher's supplies for crafting and Intelligence for crafting rolls.

## Quick Reference
1. Select a spell level for the scroll you wish to create
2. Acquire the materials listed for that scroll level
3. Use calligrapher's supplies to craft the scroll
4. For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll: 1d20 + INT modifier + proficiency with calligrapher's supplies
5. On success, mark 2 hours of progress. Once completed time equals crafting time, the scroll is complete
6. On failure, no progress is made. Three consecutive failures results in loss of all materials

## Requirements
- You must know the spell you wish to inscribe on the scroll
- You must be able to cast the spell or have access to the spell through a spellbook or similar source
- You must have proficiency with calligrapher's supplies

## Essence Types
Different spell types require different essence types:
- **Arcane Essence**: Wizard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Artificer, Bard spells
- **Divine Essence**: Cleric, Paladin spells
- **Primal Essence**: Druid, Ranger spells

## Using Scrolls
- Anyone can attempt to use a scroll
- If the spell is on your class's spell list, you automatically succeed
- If the spell is not on your class's spell list, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability
- The DC equals 10 + the spell's level
- On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no effect

## Tips
- Higher-level scrolls require more time and have higher DCs
- Scrolls are consumed when used
- Scrolls can be useful for spells you know but don't have prepared
- Creating scrolls for emergency use can be a valuable preparation strategy
- Some spells may require additional or special materials to inscribe
