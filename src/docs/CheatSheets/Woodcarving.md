# Woodcarving Cheatsheet

## Overview
Woodcarving is the art of shaping wood into weapons, tools, and decorative items. It uses woodcarver's tools for crafting and Dexterity or Strength (your choice) for crafting rolls.

## Quick Reference
1. Select an item from the "Woodcarving Crafting Table"
2. Acquire the materials listed for that item
3. Use woodcarver's tools to craft the item
4. For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll: 1d20 + DEX/STR modifier + proficiency with woodcarver's tools
5. On success, mark 2 hours of progress. Once completed time equals crafting time, the item is complete
6. On failure, no progress is made. Three consecutive failures results in loss of all materials

## Take 10 Rule
When not under pressure or distraction, a woodcarver may choose to "Take 10" on a crafting check:
- Instead of rolling a d20, automatically use a 10 for the roll
- Total: 10 + DEX/STR modifier + proficiency with woodcarver's tools
- This ensures steady progress but prevents exceptional results
- Particularly useful for simple items like clubs and tool handles
