# Basic Crafting Rules Cheatsheet

## Overview
This cheatsheet covers the fundamental rules and mechanics that apply to all crafting disciplines in D&D 5e using the Crafting 1.0.6 system.

## General Crafting Process
1. **Select an item** to craft from the appropriate crafting table
2. **Gather materials** required for the item
3. **Use appropriate tools** for the crafting discipline
4. **Make crafting checks** at regular intervals (typically every 2 hours)
5. **Track progress** until the required crafting time is completed

## Crafting Checks
- Each crafting discipline uses a specific ability score and tool proficiency
- Standard crafting check formula: `1d20 + ability modifier + proficiency bonus (if proficient with tools)`
- On success, mark 2 hours of progress toward completion
- On failure, no progress is made
- Three consecutive failures result in the loss of all materials

### Take 10 Rule
- When not under pressure or distraction, a crafter may choose to "Take 10" on a crafting check
- Instead of rolling a d20, the crafter automatically uses a 10 for the roll
- This represents taking extra time to ensure a steady, reliable result
- The total is calculated as: `10 + ability modifier + proficiency bonus (if proficient with tools)`
- "Taking 10" ensures consistent progress but prevents exceptional results

## Crafting Time
- Crafting time is measured in hours of work
- A standard workday is 8 hours
- Working more than 8 hours in a day requires a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion
- Characters can work together to reduce crafting time (see Collaborative Crafting)
