# Engineering Cheatsheet

## Overview
Engineering is the art of designing and constructing complex mechanical devices, traps, and vehicles. It uses tinker's tools or smith's tools for crafting and Intelligence for crafting rolls.

## Quick Reference
1. Select an item from the "Engineering Crafting Table"
2. Acquire the materials listed for that item
3. Use tinker's tools (for small devices) or smith's tools (for large constructions) to craft the item
4. For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll: 1d20 + INT modifier + proficiency with the appropriate tools
5. On success, mark 2 hours of progress. Once completed time equals crafting time, the item is complete
6. On failure, no progress is made. Three consecutive failures results in loss of all materials

## Engineering Specializations
- **Clockwork**: Precision mechanisms using gears and springs
- **Hydraulics**: Systems using water or fluid pressure
- **Pneumatics**: Systems using air or gas pressure
- **Explosives**: Devices that create controlled explosions
- **Architecture**: Designing and constructing buildings and structures
- **Siege Engineering**: Creating weapons of war and fortifications

## Tips
- Complex devices may require multiple engineering specializations
- Blueprints can reduce crafting DC by 2 if available
- Magical components can enhance mechanical devices
- Consider the environment where the device will be used
- Maintenance is required for long-term functionality
- Combining engineering with other crafting skills can create unique items
