# Cooking Cheatsheet

## Overview
Cooking in D&D is the art of preparing food that can provide temporary benefits to characters. It uses cook's utensils for crafting and Wisdom or Intelligence (your choice) for crafting rolls.

## Quick Reference
1. Select a recipe from the "Cooking Crafting Table"
2. Acquire the ingredients listed for that recipe
3. Use cook's utensils to prepare the meal
4. Make a cooking roll: 1d20 + WIS/INT modifier + proficiency with cook's utensils
5. On success, the meal is prepared and provides its benefits
6. On failure, the ingredients are wasted

## Take 10 Rule
When not under pressure or distraction, a cook may choose to "Take 10" on a cooking check:
- Instead of rolling a d20, automatically use a 10 for the roll
- Total: 10 + WIS/INT modifier + proficiency with cook's utensils
- This ensures steady results but prevents exceptional meals
- Useful for preparing meals for a large group where consistency is more important than excellence
