# Blacksmithing Cheatsheet

## Overview
Blacksmithing is the art of forging metal into weapons, armor, and tools. It uses smith's tools for crafting and Strength or Intelligence (your choice) for crafting rolls.

## Quick Reference
1. Select an item from the "Blacksmithing Crafting Table"
2. Acquire the materials listed for that item
3. Use smith's tools to craft the item
4. For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll: 1d20 + STR/INT modifier + proficiency with smith's tools
5. On success, mark 2 hours of progress. Once completed time equals crafting time, the item is complete
6. On failure, no progress is made. Three consecutive failures results in loss of all materials

## Take 10 Rule
When not under pressure or distraction, a blacksmith may choose to "Take 10" on a crafting check:
- Instead of rolling a d20, automatically use a 10 for the roll
- Total: 10 + STR/INT modifier + proficiency with smith's tools
- This ensures steady progress but prevents exceptional results
- Particularly useful for common weapons and tools to avoid the risk of consecutive failures

## Masterwork Items
- A masterwork item is one crafted with exceptional skill
- To create a masterwork item, every crafting roll must succeed at the Masterwork DC (typically +2 to the normal DC)
- Masterwork weapons grant a +1 bonus to attack rolls (non-magical)
- Masterwork armor grants a +1 bonus to AC (non-magical)
- Masterwork items can be enchanted more easily than standard items

## Forge Requirements
- Basic blacksmithing requires access to a forge
- Portable forges exist but are limited in what they can create
- Some items require specialized forges (e.g., mithral, adamantine)

## Tips
- Blacksmithing checks don't need to be consecutive
- You can work on multiple projects simultaneously
- Salvaging failed projects can recover some materials
- Quality of materials affects the final product
- Consider the weight of armor when crafting for specific characters
