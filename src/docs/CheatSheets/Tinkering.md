# Tinkering Cheatsheet

## Overview
Tinkering is the art of creating small mechanical devices, gadgets, and contraptions. It uses tinker's tools for crafting and Intelligence for crafting rolls.

## Quick Reference
1. Select a gadget from the "Tinkering Crafting Table"
2. Acquire the materials listed for that gadget
3. Use tinker's tools to craft the gadget
4. For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll: 1d20 + INT modifier + proficiency with tinker's tools
5. On success, mark 2 hours of progress. Once completed time equals crafting time, the gadget is complete
6. On failure, no progress is made. Three consecutive failures results in loss of all materials

## Explosive Devices
| Device | Materials | Crafting Time | Checks | DC | Value |
|--------|-----------|---------------|--------|-----|-------|
| Smoke Bomb | 1 common reactive reagent, 1 container | 2 hours | 1 | DC 12 | 25 gp |
| Flash Bomb | 1 uncommon reactive reagent, 1 container | 4 hours | 2 | DC 14 | 50 gp |
| Explosive Charge | 2 uncommon reactive reagents, 1 container | 8 hours | 4 | DC 16 | 150 gp |
| Stink Bomb | 1 common poisonous reagent, 1 container | 2 hours | 1 | DC 12 | 20 gp |

## Relationship to Other Crafting Skills
- **Engineering**: Tinkering focuses on smaller devices, while engineering deals with larger constructions
- **Blacksmithing**: Provides metal components for tinkering projects
- **Woodcarving**: Provides wooden components and casings for gadgets
- **Alchemy**: Provides reactive components for explosive or chemical gadgets

## Tips
- Tinkering devices often require maintenance after extended use
- Blueprints can reduce crafting DC by 2 if available
- Combining tinkering with alchemy can create interesting chemical gadgets
- Small size doesn't mean small impact - tiny gadgets can solve big problems
- Consider portability and durability when designing gadgets
- Tinkering is excellent for creating specialized tools for specific situations
